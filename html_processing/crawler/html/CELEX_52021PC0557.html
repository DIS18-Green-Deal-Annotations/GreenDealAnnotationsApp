      Reasons for and objectives of the proposal
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      The European Green Deal (EGD) establishes the objective of becoming climate neutral in 2050 in a manner that contributes to the European economy, growth and jobs. This objective
     </span>
     <span>
      requires a greenhouse as emissions reduction of 55%
     </span>
     <span>
      by 2030 as confirmed by the European Council in December 2020. This in turn requires significantly higher shares of renewable energy sources in an integrated energy system. The current EU target of at least 32% renewable energy by 2030, set in the Renewable Energy Directive (REDII), is not sufficient and needs to be increased to 38-40%, according to the Climate Target Plan (CTP). At the same time, new accompanying measures in different sectors in line with the Energy System Integration, the Hydrogen, the Offshore Renewable Energy and the Biodiversity Strategies are required to achieve this increased target.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      The overall objectives of the revision of REDII are to achieve an increase in the use of energy from renewable sources by 2030, to foster better energy system integration and to contribute to climate and environmental objectives including the protection of biodiversity, thereby addressing the intergenerational concerns associated with global warming and biodiversity loss. This revision of REDII is essential to achieve the increased climate target as well as to protect our environment and health, reduce our energy dependency, and contribute to the EU’s technological and industrial leadership along with the creation of jobs and economic growth.

      REDII is the main EU instrument dealing with the promotion of energy from renewable sources. The review of REDII does not stand alone. It is part of a broader exercise that affects other energy and climate legislation and policy initiatives, as announced in the EGD roadmap, and in the Commission work programme for 2021 under the title “Fit for 55 package”.

     <span>
      A cost-efficient accelerated development of sustainable renewable energy within a more integrated energy system cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone. An EU approach is needed to provide the right incentives to Member States with different levels of ambition to accelerate, in a coordinated way, the energy transition from the traditional fossil fuel based energy system towards a more integrated and more energy-efficient energy system based on renewables-based generation. Taking into account the different energy policies and priorities among Member States, action at EU level is more likely to achieve the required increased deployment of renewables than national or local action alone.

      EU added value

     <span>
      EU action on renewable energy brings added value because it is more efficient and effective than individual Member States’ actions, avoiding a fragmented approach by addressing the transition of the European energy system in a coordinated way. It ensures net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution, protects biodiversity, harnesses the benefits of the internal market, fully exploits the advantages of economies of scale and technological cooperation in Europe, and it gives investors certainty in an EU-wide regulatory framework. The achievement of an increased share of renewable energy in final EU energy consumption depends on national contributions from each Member State. These will be more ambitious and cost-effective if driven by an agreed common legal and policy framework.

       The preferred package of policy options is considered proportionate and builds to the extent possible on current policy design. Several options set a target or a benchmark to be achieved, but leave the means to achieve those targets up to the Member States.  The balance between obligations and the flexibility left to the Member States on how to achieve the objectives is considered appropriate given the imperative of achieving climate neutrality (see sections 3.3 and 7.5 of the Impact Assessment accompanying this proposal, SWD (2021) XXX).

       This proposal is for an amending Directive. Given its relatively recent adoption, this review of REDII is limited to what is considered necessary to contribute in a cost-effective way to the Union’s 2030 climate ambition, and is not a full revision of the Directive, so a recast is not considered appropriate.

      The Inception Impact Assessment (Roadmap) was published for feedback from 3 August to 21 September 2020 and 374 replies were received, from stakeholders from 21 Member States and 7 non-EU countries. Most responses came from companies or business associations, followed by NGOs, anonymous and citizens. In addition, the Commission launched an online public consultation (OPC) on 17 November 2020 for 12 weeks, in line with the Commission Better Regulation rules. It contains multiple choice and open questions covering a wide range of issues on the revision of REDII. 39,046 replies were received in total. Stakeholder views were also gathered in two workshops, the first one was held on 11 December 2020 (close to 400 participants) and the second one was on 22 March 2021 (close to 1000 participants).

      Summary of stakeholder views

    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      The majority (80%) of replies to the OPC showed a preference for an increased RES target in line with the CTP (43%) or higher (37%). 61% favoured a binding target both at EU and national level. Transport and heating and cooling were the two most popular sectors where additional efforts were considered necessary, with a majority supporting increased targets for both sectors at least at the level of the CTP. A coordinated response of more than 38,000 participants requested removing biomass from the list of renewable resources and limiting the use for bioenergy to locally available waste and residues, whereas representatives from trade unions, business and a majority of public authorities preferred not changing the current sustainability criteria for biomass.

      The views of the stakeholders as expressed in the OPC and during the workshops were taken into account when elaborating the various policy options on the respective policy areas in the impact assessment.

      The Impact Assessment (IA) accompanying the Proposal was elaborated based on modelling, stakeholder input and input from the Interservice Group. The report was submitted to the Regulatory Scrutiny Board on the 10 of March 2021. On 19 April 2021, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board delivered its first opinion on the Impact Assessment, and following the re-submission of the IA, the second was delivered on 19 May.

      Regarding the

     <span>
      overall renewable energy target
     </span>
     <span>
      level, option 0 (no change) would provide no means of ensuring that the EU-wide renewable energy target is deployed to reach at least 38-40% share in final energy consumption. Option 2 (a higher target than 40%) would potentially lead to overshooting the climate target and to a lack of coherence with other EU legislative instruments. Hence, option 1 (a minimum target in the range of 38-40%) has no drawbacks and is the thus the preferred and effective option. Regarding the nature of the target, although option 1 (national binding targets) would imply the most effective achievement of an increased RES share, this would create subsidiarity issues. The current Energy Union Governance process is an important foundation for achieving the renewables target. The first iteration of the review process of the national plans, completed in 2020, proved to be effective in that the national contributions were collectively sufficiently ambitious to reach the binding Union 2030 RES target. Under the Governance Regulation the Member States must submit their draft updates to their NECPs by June 2023, and can already show how they are planning to reach the higher target 2030 target. Given the effective nature and architecture of the current system, option 0 (maintaining the EU binding target and national voluntary contributions) is the preferred option.

      Regarding
     </span>
     <span>
      heating &amp; cooling
     </span>
     <span>
      , option 1 (non-regulatory measures) will not trigger Member States to increase efforts in the RES heating and cooling sector to at least 1.1% annual average percentage point (pp). Translating the  EU RES heating and cooling figure from the CTP  into a binding uniform increased annual average share across Member States equally as per option 3b is not considered proportionate, although it is the most effective.
     </span>
     <span>
      The level of renewables needed in 2030 could also be set as a target as proposed in option 3c but that would depart from the current model and could disrupt the already on-going implementation efforts, although it would have the added benefit of setting the end-goal in 2030 clearly. Option 3a combined with sector and EU RES buildings and industry benchmarks of appropriate design (option 3d) would be effective in providing the right mix of drivers for integrating further

      these sectors into the energy system
     </span>
     <span>
      .
     </span>
     <span>
      This option 3a would set a minimum flat rate of RES growth by making the current indicative annual increase target of 1.1 p.p. as the minimum required effort and complement it with Member State specific “top-ups” redistributing the additional efforts to the desired level of renewables in 2030 among Member States based on GDP and cost. The additional Member States specific increase rates could provide a means of assessing the relative level of ambition of each Member States in the heating and cooling sector but also as a potential gap filler measure to close the gap, if other sectors than heating and cooling would fail to deliver the 38-40% overall RES target. The option of a benchmark for the use of renewable energy in the building sector is also considered here.

     <span>
      indicative EU renewable target for renewables’ share in district heating &amp; cooling
     </span>
     <span>
      could give similar benefits as option 3c but departs from the current provisions and could be disruptive for already ongoing implementation. Option 3d (
     </span>
     <span>
      increasing the 1% percentagepoint increase target and making it binding
     </span>
     <span>
      ) would be the most effective target design, but is too stringent and leaves less room for Member States. Option 3a (
     </span>
     <span>
      no changes)
     </span>
     <span>
      would make it possible for district heating to indefinitely continue with the fossil fuels and thus is not coherent with the review’s objectives. Option 2 (list of measures) can be self-standing or complementary, as it gives a clearer enabling framework to transform district heating and cooling, make it into an enabler of renewable energy supply in buildings and to become a key heat decarbonisation instrument, while enhancing energy sector integration in national and EU energy systems. Combining option 2 on measures with the target design in option 3c is the preferred option to ensure that district heating and cooling aligns with the EGD  and becomes an enabler to deliver on the CTP and energy system integration  goals. Together with the options on overall heating and cooling and buildings, this option would also set an enabling framework to develop and expand modern renewable based smart district heating and cooling systems.

      , option 1.1 (availability of near-real-time information on the renewable share of electricity supplied by the grid) would provide  effective market incentivising signals that relate directly to renewable penetration and carbon reduction, without any administrative burden and in coherence with existing legislation. Option 1.2 (information on the RES-share and GHG emission profile would have some positive effects on consumer information, however it would otherwise bring limited added value. Options 2.1-2.3 cover different aspects of optimising the intelligent charging infrastructure, with varying levels of positive contribution to overall implementation costs and benefits to the economy. In order to provide flexibility to Member States, implementation based on national assessment was in each case selected as the preferred solution revolving around smart charging functionality, including bidirectional charging and deployment of additional smart charging points (2.1B, 2.2B and 2.3). Options 3.1-3.3 address various obstacles in the aggregation and mobility service provision market which hinder competition. Option 3.1 (ensuring that the treatment of electricity storage systems or devices by network and market operators is not discriminatory or disproportionate irrespective of their size (small-scale vs large-scale) or whether they are stationary or mobile, so that they are able to competitively offer flexibility and balancing services) is a no-regrets option.

      would perform the best overall. While all options apart from option 1 deliver on the needed level of ambition, there are substantial differences. The energy-based options may have the advantage to promote the development and production of innovative renewable and recycled carbon fuels as they provide the most predictable and stable policy framework for investments into such technologies. The GHG-intensity based options can stimulate supply chain improvements and technology efficiency in renewable and low carbon fuels, where costs of production are higher and would have the advantage of ensuring consistency with the approach chosen under the Fuel Quality Directive. This, however, would require applying changes to the methodology applied to determine the GHG emission intensity.

This is in particular valid for option 1 (extension of the scope of accounting of RFNBOs beyond transport and improvement of the consistency of accounting of RFNBOs) and option 3 (creation of specific sub-targets for RFNBOs in hard-to-decarbonise sectors).

      , option 1 (non-regulatory measures) would facilitate the implementation of the REDII sustainability criteria, but would not include additional safeguards to address the identified risks. Option 2 (targeted strengthening of the current EU bioenergy sustainability criteria) would provide the most direct safeguard against the risks of production of forest biomass in high biodiversity areas. It would also introduce additional safeguards promoting optimal lifecycle GHG emissions saving and avoiding new inefficient biomass use in the power sector. Option 3 (regulation of small installations) would further add to the effectiveness of option 2 by regulating a larger amount of biomass use for energy in the EU. It would also help improve public monitoring of biomass production and use. Building on the preferred options 2, 3 and 4.2 (requiring Member States to design their support schemes for biomass fuels in a way to minimise market distortions in the raw materials market, with the aim to minimise the use of high quality roundwood), would contribute to minimising the use of whole trees for energy production as set out in the EU Biodiversity Strategy.

Option 2 (financial support for the use of PPAs for small and medium-sized enterprises) will have a positive benefit for the uptake of renewables and the European economy.

Option 1 (introduction of use of renewable energy in the audits required in the EED) would provide an effective means to introduce industrial actors to existing cost-effective solutions to switch to renewable energy, without any administrative burden and in coherence with existing legislation. Option 2 (labelling for  industrial products in certain sectors claimed to be made from renewable energy) provides an effective means to create a uniform and coherent market for those companies that are placing products and services produced from renewable energy on the market. Any mandatory labelling would need to be carefully designed to ensure compatibility with WTO rules.

     <span>
      Overall the policy options have positive economic, environmental and societal benefits. A more secure EU energy system, less dependent on imports, would be achieved by the increase in renewable energy, in particular from offshore. The revision of REDII is likely to have positive impacts on economic growth and investments, by creating quality jobs, and reducing fossil fuel imports and energy costs for consumers and business. Many of the policy options are projected to create jobs, in line with the envisaged green digital recovery. Positive employment effects are expected, especially in sectors linked to renewable energy, with an increase in employment and skills in the construction and energy supply sectors and shift in employment between the sectors. Per euro of expenditure, renewable energy creates nearly 70 per cent more jobs than fossil fuels spending and solar PV creates more than twice the number of jobs per unit of electricity generation compared to coal or natural gas. Greater use of energy from sustainable renewable sources, including renewable hydrogen, would result in reduced GHG emissions. Replacing fossil fuels will also reduce air pollutants and have a beneficial impact on health. Renewable-based electrification of road transport would have positive impacts in particular on urban air pollution, whereas electrification of, for example, heating in buildings, would contribute substantially to reducing the GHG and other air pollutant emissions from the European building stock, which today relies heavily on fossil fuels. Air quality in cities will be improved by among others renewable heating, especially district heating in cities. Positive biodiversity impacts will follow from stronger sustainability criteria for bioenergy. It may reduce import from outside the EU of biomass fuels, as third countries choose not to comply with them and redirect their export away from the EU.

      The revision of the REDII will mainly entail practical implications for Member States public administrations given the need to comply with higher (binding) targets which need to be worked towards to and monitored accordingly. Other actions required from the public administration include promotion and facilitation of the uptake of renewable energy across multiple carriers.

       Increasing renewable energy use in heating and cooling and in buildings will require building works/renovation, leading to an increase in employment in the sector. Up to 95% of construction, architecture and civil engineering firms are small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), so there is a likely positive economic effect on SMEs. Guidance and financial support on power purchase agreements will help SMEs who do not have the resources to deal with complex contracts. More stringent forest biomass criteria may create increased administrative costs and burden for small and medium-sized economic operators.

      Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action established an integrated energy and climate planning, monitoring and reporting framework, to monitor progress towards the climate and energy targets in line with the transparency requirements of the Paris Agreement. Member States had to submit to the Commission their integrated national energy and climate plans by the end of 2019, covering the five dimensions of the Energy Union for the period 2021-2030. From 2023, Member States must report biennially on the progress made in implementing the plans and in addition, by 30 June 2023 they must notify the Commission of their draft updates of the plans, with the final updates due on 30 June 2024. This update, due in 2024, would cover planning obligations related to any new targets agreed in the revision of REDII. Any additional planning and reporting requirements set in this proposal will not create a new planning and reporting system, but would be subject to the existing planning and reporting framework under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. The future revision of the Governance Regulation would allow a consolidation of these reporting requirements.

      Following the ruling of the European Court of Justice in  Commission vs Belgium (case C-543/17), Member States must accompany their notifications of national transposition measures with sufficiently clear and precise information, indicating which provisions of national law transpose which provisions of a directive. This must be provided for each obligation, not only at “article level”. If Member States comply with this obligation, they would not need, in principle, to send explanatory documents on the transposition to the Commission.

      , with a view to ensuring fair access to the biomass raw material market for the development of innovative, high value-added bio-based solutions and a sustainable circular bioeconomy. When developing support schemes for bioenergy, Member States should therefore take into consideration the available sustainable supply of biomass for energy and non-energy uses and the maintenance of the national forest carbon sinks and ecosystems as well as  the principles of the circular economy and the biomass cascading use, and  the waste hierarchy established in Directive 2008/98/ECof the European Parliament and of the Council

      . For this, they should grant no support to the production of energy from saw logs, veener logs, stumps and roots and avoid promoting the use of quality roundwood for energy except in well-defined circumstances. In line with the cascading principle, woody biomass should be used according to its highest economic and environmental added value in the following order of priorities: 1) wood-based products, 2) extending their service life, 3) re-use, 4) recycling, 5) bio-energy and 6) disposal. Where no other use for woody biomass is economically viable or environmentally appropriate, energy recovery helps to reduce energy generation from non-renewable sources. Member States’ support schemes for bioenergy should therefore be directed to such feedstocks for which little market competition exists with the material sectors, and whose sourcing is considered positive for both climate and biodiversity, in order to avoid negative incentives for unsustainable bioenergy pathways, as identified in the JRC report ‘The use of woody biomass for energy production in the EU’

      . On the other hand, in defining the further implications of the cascading principle, it is necessary to recognise the national specificities which guide Member States in the design of their support schemesWaste prevention, reuse and recycling of waste should be the priority option. Member States should avoid creating support schemes which would be counter to targets on treatment of waste and which would lead to the inefficient use of recyclable waste. Moreover, in order to ensure a more efficient use of bioenergy, from 2026 on Member States should not give support anymore to electricity-only plants , unless the installations are in regions with a specific use status as regards their transition away from fossil fuels or if the installations use carbon capture and storage.

      The rapid growth and increasing cost-competitiveness of renewable electricity production can be used to satisfy a growing share of energy demand, for instance using heat pumps for space heating or low-temperature industrial processes, electric vehicles for transport, or electric furnaces in certain industries. Renewable electricity can also be used to produce synthetic fuels for consumption in hard-to-decarbonise transport sectors such as aviation and maritime transport. A framework for electrification needs to enable robust and efficient coordination and expand market mechanisms to match both supply and demand in space and time, stimulate investments in flexibility, and help integrate large shares of variable renewable generation. Member States should therefore ensure that the deployment of renewable electricity continues to increase at an adequate pace to meet growing demand. For this, Member States should establish a framework that includes market-compatible mechanisms to tackle remaining barriers to have secure and adequate electricity systems fit for a high level of renewable energy, as well as storage facilities, fully integrated into the electricity system. In particular, this framework shall tackle remaining barriers, including non-financial ones such as insufficient digital and human resources of authorities to process a growing number of permitting applications.

      When calculating the share of renewables in a Member State, renewable fuels of non-biological origin should be counted in the sector where they are consumed (electricity, heating and cooling, or transport). To avoid double-counting, the renewable electricity used to produce these fuels should not be counted. This would result in a harmonisation of the accounting rules for these fuels throughout the Directive, regardless of whether they are counted for the overall renewable energy target or for any sub-target. It would also allow to count the real energy consumed, taking account of energy losses in the process to produce those fuels. Moreover, it would allow for the accounting of renewable fuels of non-biological origin imported into and consumed in the Union.

      The Offshore Renewable Energy Strategy introduces an ambitious objective of 300 GW of offshore wind and 40 GW of ocean energy across all the Union’s sea basins by 2050. To ensure this step change, Member States will need to work together across borders at sea-basin level. Member States should therefore jointly define the amount of offshore renewable generation to be deployed within each sea basin by 2050, with intermediate steps in 2030 and 2040. These objectives should be reflected in the updated national energy and climate plans that will be submitted in 2023 and 2024 pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. In defining the amount, Member States should take into account the offshore renewable energy potential of each sea basin, environmental protection, climate adaptation and other uses of the sea, as well as the Union’s decarbonisation targets. In addition, Member States should increasingly consider the possibility of combining offshore renewable energy generation with transmission lines interconnecting several Member States, in the form of hybrid projects or, at a later stage, a more meshed grid. This would allow electricity to flow in different directions, thus maximising socio-economic welfare, optimising infrastructure expenditure and enabling a more sustainable usage of the sea.

      The market for renewable power purchase agreements is rapidly growing and provides a complementary route to the market of renewable power generation in addition to support schemes by Member States or to selling directly on the wholesale electricity market. At the same time, the market for renewable power purchase agreements is still limited to a small number of Member States and large companies, with significant administrative, technical and financial barriers remaining in large parts of the Union’s market. The existing measures in Article 15 to encourage the uptake of renewable power purchase agreements should therefore be strengthened further, by exploring the use of credit guarantees to reduce these agreements’ financial risks, taking into account that these guarantees, where public, should not crowd out private financing.

      Buildings have a large untapped potential to contribute effectively to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the Union. The decarbonisation of heating and cooling in this sector through an increased share in production and use of renewable energy will be needed to meet the ambition set in the Climate Target Plan to achieve the Union objective of climate neutrality. However, progress on the use of renewables for heating and cooling has been stagnant in the last decade, largely relying on increased use of biomass. Without the establishment of targets to increase the production and use of renewable energy in buildings, there will be no ability to track progress and identify bottlenecks in the uptake of renewables. Furthermore, the creation of targets will provide a long-term signal to investors, including for the period immediately after 2030. This will complement obligations related to energy efficiency and the energy performance of buildings. Therefore, indicative targets for the use of renewable energy in buildings should be set to guide and incentivise Member States’ efforts to exploit the potential of using and producing renewable energy in buildings, encourage the development of and integration of technologies which produce renewable energy while providing certainty for investors and local level engagement.

A sufficient number of high-quality training programmes and certification possibilities ensuring proper installation and reliable operation of a wide range of renewable heating and cooling systems should be made available and designed in a way to attract participation in such training programmes and certification systems. Member States should consider what actions should be taken to attract groups currently under-represented in the occupational areas in question.

      The increasing number of electric vehicles in road, rail, maritime and other transport modes will require that recharging operations are optimised and managed in a way that does not cause congestion and takes full advantage of the availability of renewable electricity and low electricity prices in the system.  In situations where bidirectional charging would assist further penetration of renewable electricity by electric vehicle fleets in transport and the electricity system in general, such functionality should also be made available. In view of the long life span of recharging points, requirements for charging infrastructure should be kept updated in a way that would cater for future needs and would not result in negative lock-in effects to the development of technology and services.

      Electric vehicle users entering into contractual agreements with electromobility service providers and electricity market participants should have the right to receive information and explanations on how the terms of the agreement will affect the use of their vehicle and the state of health of its battery. Electromobility service providers and electricity market participants should explain clearly to electric vehicle users how they will be remunerated for the flexibility, balancing and storage services provided to the electricity system and market by the use of their electric vehicle.  Electric vehicle users also need to have their consumer rights secured when entering into such agreements, in particular regarding the protection of their personal data such as location and driving habits, in connection to the use of their vehicle. Electric vehicle users’ preference regarding the type of electricity purchased for use in their electric vehicle, as well as other preferences, can also be part of such agreements. For the above reasons, it is important that electric vehicle users can use their subscription at multiple recharging points. This will also allow the electric vehicle user’s service provider of choice to optimally integrate the electric vehicle in the electricity system, through predictable planning and incentives based on the electric vehicle user preferences This is also in line with the principles of a consumer-centric and prosumer-based energy system, and the right of supplier choice of electric vehicle users as final customers as per the provisions of Directive (EU) 2019/944.

      Increasing ambition in the heating and cooling sector is key to delivering the overall renewable energy target given that heating and cooling constitutes around half of the Union's energy consumption, covering a wide range of end uses and technologies in buildings, industry and district heating and cooling. To accelerate the increase of renewables in heating and cooling, an annual 1.1 percentage point increase at Member State level should be made binding as a minimum for all Member States. For those Member States, which already have renewable shares above 50% in the heating and cooling sector, it should remain possible to only apply half of the binding annual increase rate and Member States with 60% or above may count any such share as fulfilling the average  annual increase rate in accordance with points b) and c) of paragraph 2 of Article 23. In addition, Member State-specific top-ups should be set, redistributing the additional efforts to the desired level of renewables in 2030 among Member States based on GDP and cost-effectiveness. A longer list of different measures should also be included in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 to facilitate increasing the share of renewables in heating and cooling. Member States may implement one or more measures from the list of measures.

To ensure this potential is harnessed, the annual increase of renewable energy and/or waste heat in district heating and cooling should be raised from 1 percentage point to 2.1 without changing the indicative nature of this increase, reflecting the uneven development of this type of network across the Union.

      The use of renewable fuels and renewable electricity in transport can contribute to the decarbonisation of the Union transport sector in a cost-effective manner, and improve, amongst other, energy diversification in that sector while promoting innovation, growth and jobs in the Union economy and reducing reliance on energy imports. With a view to achieving the increased target for greenhouse gas emission savings defined by the Union, the level of renewable energy supplied to all transport modes in the Union should be increased. Expressing the transport target as a greenhouse gas intensity reduction target would stimulate an increasing use of the most cost-effective and performing fuels, in terms of greenhouse gas savings, in transport. In addition, a greenhouse gas intensity reduction target would stimulate innovation and set out a clear benchmark to compare across fuel types and renewable electricity depending on their greenhouse gas  intensity.
     </span>
     <span>
      Complementary to this, increasing the level of the energy-based target on advanced biofuels and biogas and introducing a target for renewable fuels of non-biological origin would ensure an increased use of the renewable fuels with smallest environmental impact in transport modes that are difficult to electrify.
     </span>
     <span>
      The achievement of those targets should be ensured by obligations on fuel suppliers as well as by other measures included in [Regulation (EU) 2021/XXX on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport - FuelEU Maritime and Regulation (EU) 2021/XXX on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport].

In the pursuit of this goal, it is essential to also contribute to wider environmental objectives, and in particular the prevention of biodiversity loss, which is negatively impacted by the indirect land use change associated to the production of certain biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. Contributing to these climate and environmental objectives constitutes a deep and longstanding intergenerational  concern for Union citizens and the Union legislator. As a consequence, the changes in the way the transport target is calculated should not affect the limits established on how to account toward that target certain fuels produced from food and feed crops on the one hand and high indirect land-use change-risk fuels on the other hand. In addition, in order not to create an incentive to use biofuels and biogas produced from food and feed crops in transport, Member States should continue to be able to choose whether count them or not towards the transport target. If they do not count them, they may reduce the greenhouse gas intensity reduction target accordingly, assuming that food and feed crop-based biofuels save 50% greenhouse gas emissions, which corresponds to the typical values set out in an annex to this Directive for the greenhouse gas emission savings of the most relevant production pathways of food and feed crop-based biofuels as well as the minimum savings threshold applying to most installations producing such biofuels.

      Expressing the transport target as a greenhouse gas intensity reduction target makes it unnecessary to use multipliers to promote certain renewable energy sources. This is because different renewable energy sources save different amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and, therefore, contribute differently to a target. Renewable electricity should be considered to have zero emissions, meaning it saves 100% emissions compared to electricity produced from fossil fuels. This will create an incentive for the use of renewable electricity since renewable fuels and recycled carbon fuels are unlikely to achieve such a high percentage of savings. Electrification relying on renewable energy sources would therefore become the most efficient way to decarbonise road transport. In addition, in order to promote the use of advanced biofuels and biogas and renewable fuels of non-biological origin in the aviation and maritime modes, which are difficult to electrify, it is appropriate to keep the multiplier for those fuels supplied in those modes when counted towards the specific targets set for those fuels.

      Direct electrification of end-use sectors, including the transport sector,  contributes to the efficiency and facilitates the transition to an energy system based on renewable energy. It is therefore in itself an effective means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The creation of a framework on additionality applying specifically to renewable electricity supplied to electric vehicles in the transport is therefore not required.

      Since renewable fuels of non-biological origin are to be counted as renewable energy regardless of the sector in which they are consumed, the rules to determine their renewable nature when produced from electricity, which were applicable only to those fuels when consumed in the transport sector, should be extended to all renewable fuels of non-biological origin, regardless of the sector where they are consumed.

      Directive (EU) 2018/2001 strengthened the bioenergy sustainability and greenhouse gas savings framework by setting criteria for all end-use sectors. It set out specific rules for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from forest biomass, requiring the sustainability of harvesting operations and the accounting of land-use change emissions. To achieve an enhanced protection of especially biodiverse and carbon-rich habitats, such as primary forests, highly biodiverse forests, grasslands and peat lands, exclusions and limitations to source forest biomass from those areas should be introduced, in line with the approach for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from agricultural biomass. In addition, the greenhouse gas emission saving criteria should also apply to existing biomass-based installations to ensure that bioenergy production in all such installations leads to greenhouse gas emission reductions compared to energy produced from fossil fuels.

      In order to reduce the administrative burden for producers of renewable fuels and recycled carbon fuels and for Member States, where voluntary or national schemes have been recognised by the Commission through an implementing act as giving evidence or providing accurate data regarding the compliance with sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria as well as other requirements set in this Directive, Member States should accept the results of the certification issued by such schemes within the scope of the Commission’s recognition. In order to reduce the burden on small installations, Member States should establish a simplified verification mechanism for installations of between 5 and 10MW.

      The Union database to be set up by the Commission aims at enabling the tracing of liquid and gaseous renewable fuels and recycled carbon fuels. Its scope should be extended from transport to all other end-use sectors in which such fuels are consumed. This should make a vital contribution to the comprehensive monitoring of the production and consumption of those fuels, mitigating risks of double-counting or irregularities along the supply chains covered by the Union database. In addition, to avoid any risk of double claims on the same renewable gas, a guarantee of origin issued for any consignment of renewable gas registered in the database should be cancelled.

      The Governance Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 makes several references in a number of places to the Union-level binding target of at least 32 % for the share of renewable energy consumed in the Union in 2030. As that target needs to be increased in order to contribute effectively to the ambition to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 55 % by 2030, those references should be amended. Any additional planning and reporting requirements set will not create a new planning and reporting system, but should be subject to the existing planning and reporting framework under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.

      As regards bio-based components in diesel fuel, the reference in Directive 98/70/EC to diesel fuel B7, that is diesel fuel containing up to 7 % fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), limits available options to attain higher biofuel incorporation targets as set out in Directive (EU) 2018/2001. That is due to the fact that almost the entire Union supply of diesel fuel is already B7. For that reason the maximum share of bio-based components should be increased from 7% to 10%. Sustaining the market uptake of B10, that is diesel fuel containing up to 10 % fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), requires a Union-wide B7 protection grade for 7% FAME in diesel fuel due to the sizeable proportion of vehicles not compatible with B10 expected to be present in the fleet by 2030. This should be reflected in Article 4, paragraph 1, second subparagraph of Directive 98/70/EC as amended by this act.

In line with the cascading principle, woody biomass should be used according to its highest economic and environmental added value in the following order of priorities: 1) wood-based products, 2) extending their service life, 3) re-use, 4) recycling, 5) bio-energy and 6) disposal.

       Measurements of soil carbon can constitute such evidence, e.g. by a first measurement in advance of the cultivation and subsequent ones at regular intervals several years apart. In such a case, before the second measurement is available, increase in soil carbon would be estimated on the basis of representative experiments or soil models. From the second measurement onwards, the measurements would constitute the basis for determining the existence of an increase in soil carbon and its magnitude.
