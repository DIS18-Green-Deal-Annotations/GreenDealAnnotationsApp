       By contributing to around 75% of EU external trade volumes and 31% of EU internal trade volumes, maritime transport is an essential component of Europe’s transport system and plays a critical role for the European economy. Every year, around 400 million passengers embark or disembark in EU ports, including around 14 million on cruise ships. Maritime transport fulfils an important role in safeguarding the connectivity of islands and peripheral maritime regions with the rest of the single market

      The maritime transport sector operates in an environment of open markets and international competition. Maritime transport services within the EU are open to all EU shipowners, maritime transport services between EU Member States, and between EU Member States and third countries (non-EU countries), can be provided by operators of all nationalities. A level playing field for ship operators and shipping companies is critical to a well-functioning EU market for maritime transport.

     <span>
      “Both the aviation and maritime sectors will need to scale up efforts to improve the efficiency of aircraft, ships and their operations and to increase the use of sustainably produced renewable and low-carbon fuels. This will be assessed in greater detail in the context of the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime initiatives that aim to increase the production and the uptake of sustainable alternative fuels for these sectors. The necessary technology development and deployment has to happen already by 2030 to prepare for much more rapid change thereafter.”

      <span>
       Depending on the policy scenarios assessed in the framework of the 2030 Climate Target Plan (CTP) and in support of the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, renewable and low-carbon fuels should represent between 6% and 9% of the international maritime transport fuel mix in 2030 and between 86% and 88% by 2050 to contribute to the EU economy-wide GHG emissions reduction targets

       The CTP notes that the renewables share in the transport sector has to increase through the development of electrification, advanced biofuels and other renewable and low carbon fuels as part of a holistic and integrated approach, and that hydrogen based synthetic fuels will be crucial for the decarbonisation in particular in the aviation and maritime sector.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       The push for the maritime transport sector to use cleaner fuels is also present at international level. In 2018, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has adopted its initial strategy on the reduction of GHG emissions from ships. In the list of identified candidate short-term measures, the IMO includes promoting the uptake of alternative low-carbon and zero-carbon fuels and providing shore-side electricity.

       Currently, the fuel mix in the maritime sector relies entirely on fossil fuels. This can be explained by insufficient incentives for operators to cut emissions and by the lack of mature, affordable, and globally utilisable technological alternatives to fossil fuels in the sector. A number of market failures partly cause and reinforce these problems. These include:

      The FuelEU Maritime initiative proposes a common EU regulatory framework to increase the share of renewable and low-carbon fuels in the fuel mix of international maritime transport without creating barriers to the single market.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Considerations on possible obstacles to the single market, distortion of competition between operators and diversion of trade routes are particularly relevant to fuel requirements, since fuel costs make up a substantial share of ship operators’ costs. The proportion of fuel costs in the operating costs of ships can range from around 35% of the freight rate of a small tanker to around 53% for container/bulk vessels. Therefore, variations in marine fuel prices may impact significantly the economic performance of ship operators.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      At the same time, the price differential between conventional marine fuels of fossil origin and renewable low-carbon fuels remains high. To maintain competitiveness while still steering the sector towards the fuel transition that it must inevitably undertake, clear and uniform obligations are needed on ships’ use of renewable low-carbon fuels.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      An increased predictability of the regulatory framework is expected to stimulate technology development and fuel production and help the sector unlock the existing chicken-and-egg situation between demand and supply of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Clear and uniform obligations on ship’s use of energy is necessary to mitigate the risk of carbon leakage, which maritime transport is prone to due to its international nature and the possibility to bunker fuel outside the EU. Owing to the cross-border and global dimension of maritime transport, a common maritime Regulation is preferred, over a legal framework requiring EU Member States to turn EU legislation into national law. The latter could result in a patchwork of national measures with differing requirements and targets.

    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Looking in more detail at the proposed actions, there is currently no mechanism, either at the IMO level or at EU level, to correct for the presence of negative externalities (the indirect costs of emissions that are otherwise not considered) in the sector. This prevents operators from taking into account, in their operational and investment choices, the social cost of their activity in terms of climate change and air pollution. The economic literature indicates pricing mechanisms as the instruments of choice to ‘internalise’ external costs. The main examples would be a tax fixed at the level of the external cost, or a ‘cap and trade’ instrument, such as the EU Emission Trading System (ETS), that sets a limit to the overall emissions and lets the market determine their appropriate price. Both are described as ‘market-based measures’.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      However, while emissions trading can achieve GHG emissions reductions cost‑effectively and provides a uniform price signal that influences decisions of operators, investors and consumers, it does not sufficiently address all barriers to the deployment of low and zero-emissions solutions.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Additional policy actions are needed to ensure that the level playing field in maintained while removing obstacles to investments in clean energy technologies and infrastructure, in turn reducing abatement costs and complementing the action of the EU ETS. This is particularly relevant to support mitigation measures – such as the use of RLF in the maritime transport sector – that have a high potential to reduce emissions in the future but which, presently, face high abatement costs as well as specific market barriers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <div class="border">
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       While extending the EU ETS to the maritime sector will further drive energy efficiency improvements and narrow the price gap between conventional and low-emission technologies, its ability to support the rapid deployment of RLF technologies in the maritime sector strongly depends on its actual price level, which is unlikely to reach sufficient levels for this purpose in the short to medium term.

       This initiative aims at increasing the uptake of RLFs in EU maritime transport while maintaining a level playing field, both at sea and at berth, and contribute to achieving EU and international climate and environmental objectives. Ensuring a more diverse fuel mix and higher penetration of RLFs is critical to ensure the sector’s contribution to the European ambition of climate-neutrality by 2050 as laid out in the European Green Deal. At the same time, a differentiated approach to the use of RLFs in navigation and in ports is important to account for different implications on air pollution with more stringent requirements for ships in ports and different availability of technologies (more options for ships in ports).

      Maritime transport is an international sector by nature. In Europe, approximately 75% of the voyages reported under the MRV are within the European Economic Area (EEA) (and could therefore be a proxy for intra-EU traffic) and only around 9% of the traffic is estimated to be domestic voyages (between ports within the same EU Member State). The cross-border dimension of the sector is therefore essential and calls for coordinated action at EU level.

      Without action at EU level, a patchwork of regional or national requirements across EU Members States would risk triggering the development of technical solutions that may not necessarily be compatible with each other. Several EU Member States are already developing national maritime strategies that include specific approaches to ship emissions and in particular the uptake of alternative fuels

      with possible unintended effects and market distortions. As the problem drivers identified in the context of this proposal do not fundamentally differ from one EU Member State to another, and given the cross-border dimension of sector’s activities, these issues can be best addressed at EU level. EU action can also inspire and pave the way to develop future measures accelerating the uptake of alternative fuels at global level

       Previous EU action on GHG issues has already stimulated a corresponding response from the IMO, notably the EU adopting the Regulation on Monitoring, Reporting and Verification of GHG emissions from ships led shortly afterwards to the IMO adopting a similar mandatory global GHG Data Collection System. A coordinated approach by EU Member States in responding to developments in GHG emission reduction at IMO has more recently ensured that mandatory operational energy efficiency measures are included within IMO’s short term actions to reduce GHG. Projecting a common viewpoint from a considerable group of IMO Member States within the IMO fora means that the EU can have a significant impact on the direction and outcome of IMO discussions.

       The implementation of this initiative at the EU level is needed to achieve the economies of scale in the uptake of RLFs in maritime transport as well as avoiding carbon leakage, and ensuring level playing field between operators calling in EU ports and between the EU ports themselves. To give an example, obligations established at national level on the use of RLFs could divert traffic to competing ports of other Member States and distort competition. Accordingly, harmonisation at EU level is necessary to ensure a level playing field for all actors of the maritime cluster (in particular, operators, ports and fuel suppliers).

       The impact assessment established that binding, regulatory measures are necessary to achieve the objectives. A regulation is the most appropriate instrument to ensure common implementation of the measures envisaged, while reducing the risk of distortion within the single market, which could result from differences in how EU Member States turn the requirements in national law. As the transition to RLFs requires significant investments from fuel suppliers, fuel distribution and a strong and clear demand push, it is vital that the regulatory framework provides a single, long-term and robust set of rules to all investors EU-wide. In particular, it is important to avoid creating a patchwork of differing measures at national level, which would be the case if implemented under a cross-sectoral directive.

       The proposal is highly technical in nature, and there is a high likelihood that it will have to be regularly amended to reflect technical and legal developments. To respond to this, a number of implementing measures are also planned. These will focus particularly on the technical specifications to implement the functional requirements.

       The consultations confirmed that all five drivers identified in the framework of the impact assessment of the proposal are relevant. The results suggest that the different stakeholders agree that high fuel and investment costs together with uncertainty for investors are the most important barriers. In terms of policy objectives,
      </span>
      <span>
       ‘providing more certainty on the climate and environmental requirements for ships in operation’
      </span>
      <span>
       appears to be the most important policy objective in view of stakeholders.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       All stakeholder groups also expressed a preference for goal-based over prescriptive policy, which also concurs with another requirement for the policy voiced by most stakeholders, the technology neutrality. On policy measures, setting a clear regulatory pathway for decarbonising the current marine fuel received the highest scores from the stakeholders. On geographical scope, there was no obvious preference on the right geographical scope for the measures. In terms of measuring environmental performance and how emissions should be included in the policy framework, most stakeholders prefer a “well-to-wake” approach as that it takes into account not only emissions from the combustion of fuel on board the ship, but also upstream emissions from production, transport, and distribution of fuels. On ships at berth, requirements on the use of on-shore power supply are found to be relevant and necessary for achieving the decarbonisation objectives by most stakeholders.

       A study was conducted by an external contractor to support the impact assessment underpinning the proposal. This study was launched in July 2020 and was concluded in March 2021. The study provided valuable insights to the Commission services notably to design the policy options, assess some of the expected impacts, and collect the views of the directly impacted stakeholders. The Commission services also relied on the support from the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) on technical aspects related to the present initiative.

       The policy measures included in this proposal are informed by the results of an impact assessment. The impact assessment report [SWD(2021)635] received a positive opinion from the Commission Regulatory Scrutiny Board [SEC(2021)562]. In its opinion, the Board provided a number of recommendations about the presentation of the arguments in the impact assessment report. These recommendations have been addressed; Annex 1 to the impact assessment report provides a summary outline of how this was done.

       Policy options provided different ways to design the obligation and differed in particular on their approach to technology choice and the way the required performance is achieved.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       Policy option 1 is designed as a prescriptive approach, requiring share of specific fuels / fuel types to be used. It implies a technology selection by the regulator. Both policy options 2 and 3 are goal-based approaches, requiring a maximum yearly average GHG intensity limit to be met for the energy used on-board. This leaves the choice of technology to market operators. In addition, policy option 3 contains also mechanisms to reward over-achievers to encourage the development of more advanced, zero-emissions technologies (pooling and multipliers for zero-emission technologies) reducing both air pollutants and greenhouse gases. All options require the most polluting ships in ports (containerships, and passenger ships) to use on-shore power supply (or equivalent zero-emission technology).
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       Following the assessment, policy option 3 is identified as the preferred option as it strikes the best balance between the objectives and the overall implementation costs. It not only answers the needs for flexibility, which have been stressed by stakeholders during the consultation activities (in particular operators and ports), but also reduces the risk of technology lock-in [and incentivises the early adoption of most advanced technologies].

       The increased penetration of RLFs in the maritime fuel mix will translate into significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution emissions. The related savings in external costs have been estimated at EUR 10bn for air pollution and EUR 138.6bn for climate change, relative to the baseline and expressed as present value for 2021-2050 period. These have been calculated in the impact assessement based on the modelled projected penetration of renewable and low carbon fuels. Savings in the order of EUR 2.3bn are expected to be realised by ship operators due to reduced operating costs (maintenance, crew, etc.). This reduction will be driven by somewhat lower maritime transport activity relative to the baseline. An additional noticeable impact concerned the use of advanced fuels and propulsion technologies, and indirectly the impact it has on innovation. The initiative is expected to boost the penetration of fuel cell-powered vessels (18.9%) in the fleet as well as electric propulsion (5.4%) by 2050 (compared to no penetration of these technologies in the baseline).
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       The main cost resulting from the proposed intervention is borne by ship operators and amounts to EUR €89.7bn. It results from increased capital costs (EUR 25.8bn) and fuel costs (EUR 63.9bn). Indirect costs for the ports will relate to the provision of the necessary bunkering infrastructure and are estimated at EUR 5.7bn. Administrative costs for ship operators are estimated at EUR 521.7m resulting from data collection, submission and verification of the compliance plans and the annual energy report, cooperation during audits and inspections as well as crew training. Additional EUR 1.8m have been identified for the establishment of guidelines by ports to guarantee the safe handling of RLFs. Specific costs related to fuel certification could not be quantified. Enforcement costs for public authorities are expected to be limited (EUR 1.5m) and focus on the provision of the necessary IT reporting tools. The preferred option thus provides net benefits amounting to EUR 58.4bn over the time horizon of the initiative.

This is based on the cost of THETIS-MRV and experience with existing THETIS-EU modules supporting various pieces of EU legislation, such IT-developments costs are estimated at EUR 300,000. The preferred policy option would also need an additional functionality to support the pooling of ships for compliance. This additional tool is estimated to cost EUR 200,000.

      emissions. 400 million passengers embark or disembark annually in ports of Member States, including around 14 million on cruise ships. Maritime transport is therefore an essential component of Europe’s transport system and plays a critical role for the European economy. The maritime transport market is subject to strong competition between economic actors in the Union and beyond for which a level playing field is indispensable. The stability and prosperity of the maritime transport market and its economic actors rely on a clear and harmonised policy framework where maritime transport operators, ports and other actors in the sector can operate on the basis of equal opportunities. Where market distortions occur, they risk putting ship operators or ports at a disadvantage compared to competitors within the maritime transport sector or in other transport sectors. In turn, this can result in a loss of competitiveness of the maritime transport industry, and a loss of connectivity for citizens and businesses

      To enhance the Union’s climate commitment under the Paris Agreement and set out the steps to be taken to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, and to translate the political commitment into a legal obligation, the Commission adopted the (amended) proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality and amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 (European Climate Law)

      . This also integrates the target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels by 2030. Accordingly, various complementary policy instruments are needed to motivate the use of sustainably produced renewable and low-carbon fuels, included in the maritime transport sector. The necessary technology development and deployment has to happen by 2030 to prepare for much more rapid change thereafter.

      In the context of fuel transition to renewable and low carbon fuels and substitute sources of energy, it is essential to ensure the proper functioning of and fair competition in the EU maritime transport market regarding marine fuels, which account for a substantial share of ship operators’ costs. Differences in fuel requirements across Member States of the Union can significantly affect ship operators’ economic performance and negatively impact competition in the market. Due to the international nature of shipping, ship operators may easily bunker in third countries and carry large amounts of fuel. This may lead to carbon leakage and detrimental effects on the competitiveness of the sector if the availability of renewable and low carbon fuels in maritime ports under the jurisdiction of a Member State is not accompanied by requirements for their use that apply to all ship operators arriving at and departing from ports under the jurisdiction of Member States. This Regulation should lay down measures to ensure that the penetration of renewable low-carbon fuels in the marine fuels market takes place under the conditions of fair competition on the EU maritime transport market.

      In order to produce an effect on all the activities of the maritime transport sector, it is appropriate that this Regulation covers a share of the voyages between a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State and port under the jurisdiction of a third country. This Regulation should thus apply to half of the energy used by a ship performing voyages arriving at a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State from a port outside the jurisdiction of a Member State, half of the of the energy used by a ship performing voyages departing from a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State and arriving at a port outside the jurisdiction of a Member State, the entirety of the energy used by a ship performing voyages arriving at a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State from a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State, and the energy used at berth in a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State. Such  coverage of a share of the energy used by a ship in both incoming and outgoing voyages between the Union and third countries ensures the effectiveness of this Regulation, including by increasing the positive impact on the environment of such framework.  Simultaneously, such framework  limits the risk of evasive port calls and the risk of delocalisation of transhipment activities outside the Union. In order to ensure smooth operation of maritime traffic, a level playing field among maritime transport operators and among ports, and avoid distortions in the internal market, all journeys arriving or departing from ports under jurisdiction of Member States, as well as the stay of ships in those ports should be covered by uniform rules contained in this Regulation.

In line with the polluter pays principle, the shipping company could, by means of a contractual arrangement, hold the entity that is directly responsible for the decisions affecting the greenhouse gas intensity of the energy used by the ship accountable for the compliance costs under this Regulation.

      While instruments such as carbon pricing or targets on the carbon intensity of activity promote improvements in energy efficiency, they are not suited to bring about a significant shift towards renewable and low-carbon fuels in the short and medium term. A specific regulatory approach dedicated to the deployment of renewable and low-carbon marine fuels and substitute sources of energy, such as wind or electricity, is therefore necessary.

      Policy intervention to stimulate demand of renewable and low-carbon maritime fuels should be goal-based and respect the principle of technological neutrality. Accordingly, limits should be set on the greenhouse gas intensity of the energy used on-board by ships without prescribing the use of any particular fuel or technology.

      Development and deployment of renewable and low carbon fuels with a high potential for sustainability, commercial maturity and a high potential for innovation and growth to meet future needs should be promoted. This will support creating innovative and competitive fuels markets and ensure sufficient supply of sustainable maritime fuels in the short and long term to contribute to Union transport decarbonisation ambitions, while strengthening Union’s efforts towards a high level of environmental protection. For this purpose, sustainable maritime fuels produced from feedstock listed in Parts A and B of Annex IX of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, as well as synthetic maritime fuels should be eligible. In particular, sustainable maritime fuels produced from feedstock listed in Part B of Annex IX of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 are essential, as currently the most commercially mature technology to decarbonise martime transport already in the short term.

      Indirect land-use change occurs when the cultivation of crops for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels displaces traditional production of crops for food and feed purposes. Such additional demand increases the pressure on land and can lead to the extension of agricultural land into areas with high-carbon stock, such as forests, wetlands and peatland, causing additional greenhouse gas emissions and loss of biodiversity. Research has shown that the scale of the effect depends on a variety of factors, including the type of feedstock used for fuel production, the level of additional demand for feedstock triggered by the use of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, and the extent to which land with high-carbon stock is protected worldwide. The level of greenhouse gas emissions caused by indirect land-use change cannot be unequivocally determined with the level of precision required for the establishment of emission factors required by the application of this regulation. However, there is evidence that all fuels produced from feedstock cause indirect land-use change to various degrees. In addition to the greenhouse gas emissions linked to indirect land-use change – which is capable of negating some or all greenhouse gas emissions savings of individual biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels – indirect land-use change poses risks to biodiversity. This risk is particularly serious in connection with a potentially large expansion of production determined by a significant increase in demand. Accordingly, no feed and food crop-based fuels should be promoted. Directive (EU) 2018/2001 already limits and sets a cap  on the contribution of such biofuels, bioliquids and biomass to the GHG emissions savings targets in the road and rail transport sector considering their lower environmental benefits, lower performance in terms of greenhouse reduction potential and broader sustainability concerns.

      However, this approach must be stricter in the maritime sector. The maritime sector has currently insignificant levels of demand for food and feed crops-based biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, since over 99% of currently used marine fuels are of fossil origin. Therefore, the non-eligibility of food and feed crop-based fuels under this Regulation also minimises any risk to slow down the decarbonisation of the transport sector, which could otherwise result from a shift of crop-based biofuels from the road to the maritime sector. It is essential to minimise such a shift, as road transport currently remains by far the most polluting transport sector and the maritime transport currently uses predominanetly fuels of fossil origin. It is therefore appropriate to avoid the creation of a potentially large demand of food and feed crops-based biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels by promoting their use under this Regulation. Accordingly, the additional greenhouse gas emissions and loss of biodiversity caused by all types of feed and food crop-based fuels require that these fuels be considered to have the same emission factors as the least favourable pathway.

      This Regulation should establish the methodology and the formula that should apply to calculate the yearly average greenhouse gas intensity of the energy used on-board by a ship. This formula should be based on the fuel consumption reported by ships and consider the relevant emission factors of these fuels. The use of substitute sources of energy, such as wind or electricity, should also be reflected in the methodology.

      In order to provide a more complete picture of the environmental performance of the various energy sources, the GHG performance of fuels should be assessed on a well-to-wake basis, taking into account the impacts of energy production, transport, distribution and use on-board. This is to incentivise technologies and production pathways that provide a lower GHG footprint and real benefits compared to the existing conventional fuels.

      The use of renewable energy sources and alternative propulsion, such as wind and solar energy, greatly reduces the greenhouse gas intensity of the overall ship energy use. The difficulty to accurately measure and quantify these energy sources (intermittence of the energy use, direct transfer as propulsion, etc.) should not impede their recognition in the overall ship energy use through means of approximations of their contribution to the ship’s energy balance.

      Air pollution produced by ships (sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter) at berth is a significant concern for coastal areas and port cities. Therefore, specific and stringent obligations should be imposed to reduce emissions at berth from ships that draw power from their engines during their stay in port. According to the data collected within the framework of Regulation (EU) 2015/757 in 2018, passenger ships and containerships are the ship categories producing the highest amount of emissions per ship at berth. Accordingly, emissions from these categories of ships should be addressed as a priority.

      The use of on-shore power supply (OPS) abates air pollution produced by ships as well as reduces the amount of GHG emissions generated by maritime transport. OPS represents an increasingly clean power supply available to ships at berth, in view of the growing renewables share in the EU electricity mix. While only the provision on OPS connection points is covered by Directive 2014/94/EU (Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive – AFID), the demand for and, as a result, the deployment of this technology has remained limited. Therefore specific rules should be established to mandate the use of OPS by the most polluting ships.

      In addition to OPS, other technologies might be capable of offering equivalent environmental benefits in ports. When the use of an alternative technology is demonstrated to be equivalent to the use of OPS, a ship should be exempted from its use of OPS.

      Exceptions to the use of OPS should also be provided for a number of objective reasons, certified by the managing body of the port of call and limited to unscheduled port calls for reasons of safety or saving life at sea, for short stays of ships at berth of less than two hours as this is the minimum time required for connection, and for the use of on-board energy generation under emergency situations.

      Exceptions in case of unavailability or incompatibility of OPS should be limited after ship and port operators have had sufficient time to make the necessary investments, in order to provide the necessary incentives for those investments and avoid unfair competition. As of 2035, ship operators should plan carefully their port calls to make sure that they can carry out their activities without emitting air pollutants and GHG at berth and compromise the environment in coastal areas and port cities. A limited number of exceptions in case of unavailability or incompatibility of OPS shoud be maintained in order to provide the possibility for occasional last-minute changes in port call schedules and calls in ports with incompatible equipment.

      fuels of non-biological origin and recycled carbon fuel should rely on the rules established by Directive (EU) 2018/2001. This approach of certification should also apply to fuels bunkered outside the Union, which should be considered as imported fuels, in a similar way as Directive

      Compliance with this Regulation would depend on elements that could be beyond control of the company, such as issues related to fuel availability or fuel quality. Therefore, companies should be allowed the flexibility of rolling-over a compliance surplus from one year to another or borrowing an advance compliance surplus, within certain limits, from the following year. The use of OPS at berth, being of high importance for local air quality in port cities and coastal areas should not be eligible for similar flexibility provisions.

      In order to avoid technology lock-in and continue supporting the deployment of most performant solutions, companies should be allowed to pool the performances of different ships and use the possible over-performance of one ship to compensate for the under-performance of another ship.

The possibility to opt for pooled compliance should remain voluntary and subject to agreement of the concerned companies.

      Without prejudice to the possibility of complying through the flexibility and pooling provisions, the ships that do not meet the limits on the yearly average greenhouse gas intensity of the energy used on-board shall be subject to a penalty that has dissuasive effect. The penalty should be proportionate to the extent of the non-compliance and remove any economic advantage of non-compliance, thus preserving a level playing field in the sector. It should be based on the amount and cost of renewable and low-carbon fuel that the ships should have used to meet the requirements of the Regulation.

      The penalty imposed for each non-compliant port call should be proportionate to the cost of using the electricity and at sufficient level to have a dissuasive effect from the use of more polluting energy sources. The penalty should be based on the power installed on board the vessel, expressed in megawatts, multiplied by a fixed penalty in EUR per hour of stay at berth. Due to lack of accurate figures on the cost of providing OPS in the Union, this rate should be based on the EU average electricity price for non-household consumers multiplied by a factor of two to account for other charges related to the provision of the service, including among others connection costs and investment recovery elements.

      Given the international dimension of the maritime sector, a global approach to limiting the greenhouse gas intensity of the energy used by ships is preferable as it could be regarded as more effective due to its broader scope. In this context, and with a view to facilitating the development of international rules within the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the Commission should share relevant information on the implementation of this Regulation with the IMO and other relevant international bodies and relevant submissions should be made to the IMO.

      The uptake of renewable and low-carbon fuels and substitute sources of energy by ships arriving at, within or departing from ports under the jurisdiction of a Member State across the Union, is not an objective that can be sufficiently achieved by the Member States without risking to introduce barriers to the internal market and distortions of competition between ports and between maritime operators. This objective can be better achieved by introducing uniform rules at Union level that create economic incentives for maritime operators to continue operating unimpededly while meeting obligations on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Accordingly, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.

     <span>
      Fugitive emissions are emissions caused by the amount of fuel that does not reach the combustion chamber of the combustion unit or that is not consumed by the energy converter because they are uncombusted, vented, or leaked from the system. For the purpose of this Regulation, fugitive emissions are taken into account as a percentage of the mass of the fuel used by the engine. The default values are contained in Annex II.
