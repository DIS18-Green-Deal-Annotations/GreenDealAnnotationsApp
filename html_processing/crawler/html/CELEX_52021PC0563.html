      The taxation of energy products and electricity plays an important role in the area of climate and energy policy. The harmonized rules set under the Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity ("Energy Taxation Directive" or "ETD") aim to ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market.
     </span>

    <p class="Normal">

      However, since the adoption of the ETD, the underlying climate and energy policy framework changed radically and the Directive is no longer aligned with current EU policies. Furthermore, the ETD is no longer ensuring a proper functioning of the internal market.

      The proposal for recasting is part of the European Green Deal ("EGD") and of the Fit for 55 legislative package, as it focuses on environmental and climate issues to support the Commission’s commitment to tackling environmental-related challenges and achieve the EU’s domestic greenhouse gas emissions reductions objectives and air pollution reduction

      The EGD launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society. It reaffirms the Commission’s ambition to increase its climate ambition and make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The necessity and value of the European Green Deal have only grown in light of the very severe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and economic well-being of the Union’s citizens.

     <span>
      In order to follow the pathway proposed in the European Climate Law, and deliver this increased level of ambition for 2030, the Commission has reviewed the climate and energy related legislation currently in place. The
     </span>
     <span>
      ‘Fit for 55’
     </span>
     <span>
      legislative package, as announced in the 2030 Climate Target Plan, is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to  contribute.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      In the EGD the Commission committed to review the ETD focusing on environmental issues and in order to ensure that energy taxation is aligned with climate objectives. Taxation plays a direct role in supporting the green transition by sending the right price signals and providing the right incentives for sustainable consumption and production.
     </span>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      In this context, effective environmental taxation and the removal of incentives for fossil fuel consumption throughout the EU are needed to deliver the greenhouse gas emission reductions together with other regulatory measures.
     </span>
    </p>
    <div class="border">
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       The ETD can contribute to the increased ambition of at least 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 by ensuring that the taxation of motor and heating fuels reflects better the impact they have on the environment and on health. This can be achieved by removing disadvantages for clean technologies and introducing higher levels of taxation for inefficient and polluting fuels, in complement to carbon pricing through emissions trading. It will facilitate the transition away from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy to deliver on the EU’s climate neutrality objective, in line with the commitments under the Paris Agreement.

      </span>
      <span>
       energy taxation can play an important role as one of the economic incentives that steer successful energy transition, driving low greenhouse gas emissions and energy savings investments while contributing to sustainable growth and invited the Commission to
      </span>
      <span>
       revise the ETD.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       The current ETD raises a series of issues linked to its disconnection from climate and energy efficiency objectives and its shortcomings regarding the functioning of the internal market.
      </span>
     </p>
    </div>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Firstly, the ETD is not in line with EU climate and energy objectives. The Directive does not adequately promote greenhouse gas emissions reductions, energy efficiency and the take-up of electricity and alternative fuels (renewable hydrogen, synthetic fuels, advanced biofuels, etc.). The reason for this is that new, less carbon-intensive fuels are taxed as their fossil equivalent if the new fuel emerged since the 2003 adoption of the last ETD and therefore there is no explicit rate for it. Biofuels are disadvantaged by the volume-based taxation (rates expressed per litre). The reason for it is that one litre biofuel typically has a lower energy content than one litre of the competing fossil fuel while the same tax rate applies. As an overall result, the ETD does not provide sufficient incentives for investments in clean technologies.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="NormalWeb">
     <span>
      Secondly, the ETD
     </span>
     <span>
      de facto
     </span>
     <span>
      favours fossil fuel use. Highly divergent national rates are applied in combination with a wide range of tax exemptions and reductions. The wide range of exemptions and reductions are forms of fossil fuel incentives, which are not in line with the objectives of the EGD.
     </span>
     <span>
      The new proposal would help reducing the use of fossil fuels in two ways. Firstly, by setting higher rates for fossil fuels and lower rates for renewables products thereby decreasing the relative price advantage of fossil fuels over less polluting alternatives. This would discourage the use of fossil fuels. Secondly by reviewing the possibility of tax reductions and exemptions, which currently lower the taxation of fossil fuels. Those include gas oil used in agriculture, gas oil and coal used by households to heat (the possibility to exempt vulnerable households would remain) or fossil fuels used by energy intensive industries. Moreover, the proposal would end the current mandatory exemption of the aviation and waterborne navigation and fishing sector.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="NormalWeb">
     <span>
      Thirdly, the ETD is no longer contributing to the proper functioning of the internal markets the minimum tax rates have lost their converging effect on national tax rates. Minimum rates are low as they have not been updated since 2003 although national rates are significantly above the ETD minima in most cases.  In any case, the ETD minima therefore do no longer prevent a “race to the bottom” nor constitute a floor for taxation.
     </span>
     <span>
      All this, joined to the existence of exemptions and reductions, increases the fragmentation of the internal market and in particular distorts the level playing field across the involved sectors of the economy.
     </span>
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="content">
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      In addition, there are some aspects of the ETD that lack clarity, relevance and coherence, which creates legal uncertainty. These include, among others, the definition of taxable products and uses that are out of the scope of the Directive and the interpretation of the exemption related to motor fuels used in air and waterborne navigation.
     </span>
     <span>
      The present proposal, therefore, aims at the following objectives:

     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="NormalWeb">
     <span>
      As mentioned above, these objectives will be achieved by switching from volume to energy content based taxation, by eliminating incentives for fossil fuel use and by introducing a ranking of rates according to their environmental performance.  Moreover, the current tax structure will be simplified by grouping energy products (used as motor or heating fuels) and electricity into categories and by ranking them according to their environmental performance. The ‘environmental performance’ has been defined in relation to other EU policies under the European Green Deal and in particular to the rest of the proposals in the “Fit for 55” package. According to this ranking, conventional fossil fuels, such as gas oil and petrol will be taxed at the highest rate. The next category of rates applies to fuels that are fossil based but are less harmful and still have some potential to contribute to decarbonisation in the short and medium term. 2/3 of the reference rate applies for example to natural gas, LPG and hydrogen of fossil origin for a transitional period of 10 years. Thereafter this rate will increase to the full reference rate. The next category is that of sustainable but not advanced biofuels. To reflect their contribution to decarbonisation, ½ of the reference rate applies. The lowest rate applies to electricity, regardless of its use, advanced biofuels, bioliquids, biogases and hydrogen of renewable origin. The rate applicable to this group is set significantly below the reference rate as electricity and these fuels can drive the EU’s clean energy transition towards achieving the objectives of the European Green Deal and ultimately climate neutrality by 2050.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="NormalWeb">
     <span>
      In some sectors, mainly in those that may currently benefit from total exemptions such as aviation, or heating fuels for non- vulnerable households, transition periods will apply to mitigate the economic and social costs of introducing taxation.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="NormalWeb">
     <span>
      The proposal also takes into account the social dimension by introducing the possibility to exempt vulnerable households from taxation of heating fuels for a period of ten years and by introducing a transitional period of ten years for attaining the minimum rate of taxation.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="NormalWeb">
     <span>
      Member States can also grant reductions not below the minima to heating fuels for all households. It is up to Member States to decide on the use of tax revenues and they can further ensure fairness by using those revenues to mitigate the social impact.

      This proposal for recasting of the ETD is part of this coherently designed package. In complement to the other proposals in the package, it contributes to the EU climate targets by addressing exemptions and reductions in energy taxation that constitute de facto fossil fuel incentives, while promoting energy efficiency and the take-up of cleaner fuels.  The proposal for recasting of the ETD and the proposal revising the EU ETS, including the introduction of emissions trading for buildings and road transport, therefore complement each other.

       The shortcomings of the present Directive can only be remedied by means of a revision of the ETD, in coordination with other EU policy measures. Under the existing ETD, Member States can increase the rates of their taxes on energy products and electricity, decide not to make use of possible exemptions and reductions or introduce environmental and climate related objectives. However, such national approaches risk distorting the internal market and undermining the EGD objectives due to the non-harmonised structure and level of the national taxes:

      The ETD initially made an overall positive contribution towards its main objective of ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market, preventing double taxation or any distortion of trade and competition between energy sources and energy consumers and suppliers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      However, as technologies, national tax rates and energy markets evolved over the past 15 years, the ETD in its present form no longer delivers the same positive contribution. Furthermore, the EU legislative framework and policy objectives developed significantly since the adoption of the ETD in 2003 resulting in some issues of relevance and coherence. As a result, the overall EU added value of the ETD eroded significantly over time in particular due to the lack of indexation of the minimum rates and the extensive and highly divergent use of optional tax exemptions by Member States and because of the changing policy environment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      The present ETD contributes only to a very limited extent to the wider economic, social and environmental EU policy objectives. The ETD is at least partially coherent with policy efforts to promote the use of renewable energy and increased energy efficiency but less so with regard to the reduction of greenhouse and other gas emissions as well as energy diversification or energy independence and security. The main reasons identified for this lack of coherence include disregard of the energy content and CO
     </span>
     <span>
      2
     </span>
     <span>
      emissions of energy products and electricity, (too) low minimum levels of taxation and (too) many exemptions. For the same reasons, the ETD does not contribute to the decarbonisation of transport and the reduction of the air pollution emissions. As a result, the contribution of the ETD to meeting the objectives set in international agreements such as the 2015 Paris Agreement is limited.
     </span>
     <span>
     </span>
     <span>
      Moreover, the ETD does not differentiate between renewable and carbon intensive sources of electricity nor does it take into account the environmental performance of biofuels. The ETD provisions on taxation of biofuels are therefore not in line with the EU energy, climate change and environment policies.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      The ETD covers a shrinking share of the EU's energy mix as new technologies and products (e.g. power- to- gas, fuels of non- biological origin) continue to emerge or come to importance. Consequently, the current regime of energy taxation cannot ensure preferential treatment of environmentally sustainable new technologies and products. For example, despite the growing market relevance of renewable fuels, their tax treatment under the ETD still relies on rules developed at that time when these fuels were niche alternatives.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      The current ETD disadvantages petrol compared to diesel in the form of a lower minimum rate for diesel. This creates higher demand for diesel. Furthermore, emerging fuels are also disadvantaged. If they are not explicitly listed in the current ETD, the tax rate of the fuel that is used for equivalent purposes applies. The per litre energy content of these fuels is typically lower than that of the equivalent fuel. This leads to a higher per litre tax rate for new fuels.  Moreover, the mandatory tax exemption concerning international aviation and waterborne navigation is in particular problematic because is not coherent with the present climate challenges and policies.

     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Regarding aviation, the EU has negotiated, on behalf of the Union and of the Member States, horizontal air services agreements and comprehensive air transport agreements with third countries. Additionally, Member States have also concluded bilateral air services agreement with third countries. The horizontal air services agreements allow the EU to amend a number of provisions in Member States’ bilateral agreements. The comprehensive air transport agreements supersede the bilateral agreements that have been concluded by individual Member States with third countries. In most situations, those agreements allow for the taxation of fuel supplied in Member States’ territory for use in an aircraft that operates flights inside the EU.

    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Minimum rates for heating fuels are too low to contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market as they represent only a negligible share of the price of these products. Moreover, the use of optional exemptions and reductions granted to households and business users alike further increase divergence, leading to effective taxation rates being significantly lower in some Member States than in others.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Highly divergent rates on electricity and natural gas are applied in combination with a wide range of tax exemptions and reductions which contribute to increase the fragmentation of the internal market.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      As the levels of taxation under the ETD do not reflect any specific logic – for example, by not taking into account the energy content and externalities – Member States are allowed to set their national rates as they wish without having to follow any indication or ratio between products. Consequently, the current ETD can result in inappropriate price signals to users, disincentivising them from choosing greener and more efficient energy sources and no consistent treatment of energy sources is ensured at the national level.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      The ETD did not create any considerable regulatory burden or cost for the Member States or the economic operators to comply with the Directive. Much of the costs and burdens come either from horizontal legislation or national implementing measures not prescribed in the Directive and varying significantly across Member States or sector of economic activity.

    </p>
    <div class="border">
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       The difficulties with the ETD’s implementation related to the complexity, the lack of clarity, ambiguous wording and interpretations of some of the ETD provisions. This in turn led to uncertainties such as unclear conditions for eligibility to preferential tax treatment. Such uncertainty can represent a cost for tax authorities and economic operators, particularly when it leads to litigation, expressed as opportunity costs or legal expenses.

    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      The public consultation was open from 22 July 2020 to 14 October 2020. In total, 563 responses from 25 Member states and from 5 third countries were received, together with 129 position papers. An overwhelming majority of respondents agree with the general EU objectives of fighting climate change and pollution and with the application of these objectives to the revision of the ETD. In terms of priorities for the ETD review, most respondents agreed that the ETD revision should take into account greenhouse gas emissions in the definition of rates (which should also be expressed in energy content rather than in volume) and should introduce incentives for alternative energy sources such as clean hydrogen and sustainable biofuels. Overall, respondents showed their disagreement with taxation of sectors at risk of carbon leakage. The public consultation revealed some support to equalising the taxes for different transport modes so that they can compete on a level playing field and the development of more energy efficient and low carbon transport modes. With respect to accompanying social measures, most of the respondents supported a tax shift from labour taxation and social security contributions as well as social welfare programmes directed at poor households.

      Option 2 introduces a system of simplified rates. Minimum rates would be indexed and based on energy content and a transitional period (10 years for option 2a and a shorter period until 2030 for option 2b) would be applied. It focuses on energy content with an increased taxation level (mostly for heating fuels) and extension of the taxable base to intra-EU navigation in aviation and maritime sectors would be included in the scope of the Directive with minimum rates which would be linearly increased during a transitional period of 10 years. Option 2c introduces a new component in order to determine the rates that takes into account air pollutant emissions of the products on top of the features of option 2a.

      Considering that emissions trading should be introduced for carbon emissions of road transport and buildings, as proposed in the revision of the EU ETS proposal under the “Fit for 55” package, option 2a is considered the best option because it avoids any overlap between the two mechanisms.

      A well-calibrated extension of the EU ETS to the maritime sector and introduction of emissions trading to road transport and buildings, coupled with option 2 for the ETD would help to achieve the EU’s ambitious climate objective of 55% emission reductions by 2030 while allowing attaining the rest of the objectives of the ETD review.

      The impact assessment also showed that the ETD revision would not create an undue burden on the economy. The objectives set out above can be achieved with very limited economic costs and the revision can potentially bring economic benefits, in particular if additional revenue from general energy consumption taxation would be used by Member States for compensating unintended social costs.

      The impact assessment has shown that increased taxation of fossil fuels may impact more on low-income households, in particular for heating. In those cases, the possible regressivity of energy taxes could be compensated by recycling those revenues to support the green transition through financing investments in low-carbon and energy efficient goods and appliances or though lump sum transfers.

       Regarding waterborne navigation, considering the risk of tankering fuel outside the EU, a different level of taxation would be applicable to the use of energy products and electricity for intra-EU (from an EU port to another EU port) maritime and inland waterways regular service navigation, fishing and freight transport. Energy products and electricity used for the remaining intra-EU waterborne navigation (including among others navigation of private pleasure crafts) should be subject to the standard levels of taxation applicable to motor fuels and electricity in the Member States.
