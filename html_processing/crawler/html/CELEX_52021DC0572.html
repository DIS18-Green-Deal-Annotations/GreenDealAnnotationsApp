      Forests have long held a hugely important role in our economy and society, creating jobs and providing food, medicines, materials, clean water and more. For centuries, forests have been a thriving hub for cultural heritage and craftsmanship, tradition and innovation. But as important they were in the past, they are essential for our future. Forests are a natural ally in adapting to and fighting against climate change and will play a vital role in making Europe the first climate neutral continent by 2050.  Protecting forest ecosystems also lessens the risk of zoonotic diseases and global pandemics. A healthy future for people, planet and prosperity therefore depends on ensuring healthy, biodiverse and resilient forests across Europe and the world.

      Despite this imperative, European forests are under increasing strain – partly as a result of natural processes but also because of increased human activity and pressures. While forest area has become bigger in the last decades thanks to natural processes, afforestation, sustainable management and active restoration and while this has resulted in several trends moving upwards, the forest conservation status should be considerably improved, including in the

It is anchored in the European Green Deal and the EU 2030 Biodiversity Strategy and it recognises the central and multi-functional role of forests,

      To succeed in this transition we will need larger, healthier and more diverse forests than we have today, notably for carbon storage and sequestration, reduction of the effects of air pollution on human health and halting loss of habitats and species. This is a precondition for forests to be able to provide livelihoods and deliver on their socio-economic functions for decades to come. To get there, we will have to reverse negative trends, improve monitoring to better capture the state of our forests, as well as step up our efforts to protect and restore forest biodiversity and with that ensure forest resilience. We must equally importantly guarantee the availability of wood, as well as boost non-wood forest-based economic activities to diversify local economies and jobs in rural areas.

To further support sustainable forest-based bioeconomy for a climate neutral future, the strategy proposes measures for innovation and promotion of new materials and products to replace fossil-based counterparts as well as for boosting the non-wood forest economy, including ecotourism. The Strategy also focuses on sustainable re- and afforestation and is accompanied by a roadmap for planting at least 3 billion additional trees in the EU by 2030.

      It is crucial that, when building a sustainable and climate-neutral economy, we optimise the use of wood in line with the cascading principle, in particular through market incentives. This means that wood should be used as much as possible for long-lived materials and products to substitute their carbon intensive and fossil-based counterparts, for example in buildings and furniture, whilst acknowledging that not all wood is fit for such purpose. The processing innovations in this field can also provide bio-based materials and products with lower environmental footprint than the fossil-based ones.

    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Short-lived wood-based products also have a role to play, especially in substituting their fossil-based counterparts. Wood used for the production of short-lived products and also for energy production should rely on wood that is unsuitable for long-lived materials and products, and secondary woody biomass such as sawmill by-products, residues and recycled materials.

Priority should be on better using, reusing and recycling all wood-based products, including for example from construction and demolition sites, as enhanced circularity of products offers a possibility of maintaining all wood-based products longer in the economy for the multiple uses.

      The supply of wood products should be done in synergy with improving the conservation status of European and global forests, and preserving and restoring biodiversity for forest resilience, climate adaptation and forest multifunctionality. Wood of high ecological value should not be used, and the wood-based bioeconomy should remain within the boundaries of sustainability and be compatible with the EU’s 2030 and 2050 climate targets and biodiversity objectives.

      In addition to the wood-based economy, forests offer a variety of equally important additional products and services, from food to ecotourism, which support the economies and the social fabric in rural areas. The estimated value of all harvested non-wood products in Europe is EUR 19.5 billion per year. This amounts to EUR 77,80 per hectares per year. 86% of the harvested non-wood forest products are for personal consumption.

      Wood based bioenergy is currently the main source of renewable energy, supplying 60% of EU’s renewable energy use. To meet the at least 55% emission reduction target by 2030, Member States will need to significantly increase the share of renewable sources in their energy mix. Bioenergy will continue to have a notable role to play in this mix if biomass is produced sustainably and used efficiently, in line with the cascading principle and taking into account the Union’s carbon sink and biodiversity objectives as well as the overall availability of wood within sustainability boundaries in 2030 perspective

      In light of climate change and biodiversity loss there is an urgent need for adaptive forest restoration and ecosystem-based management approaches that strengthen the resilience of EU forests. This is a precondition for forests to be able to deliver on their socio-economic and environmental functions for future generations, and enable a flourishing forest-based bio-economy for decades to come. But it is also to avoid escalating socio-economic costs from forest disasters, protect people, land and houses from floods, fires and landslides, and preserve the carbon stock and sink function and other ecosystem services provided by forests that are vital for human health and wellbeing, such as clean air, water regulation, and habitat for the variety of living species they host.

      To improve forest resilience and adaptation, it is necessary to increasingly protect and restore forest biodiversity and adopt biodiversity-friendly forest management practices. This is also a great economic opportunity, provided forest owners and managers are properly supported in the transition.

      In addition, we need robust approaches to risk reduction in the context of significant uncertainty related to future forests. The onset of climate change means forest change. Europe’s vegetation zones have started to shift upwards and northwards, triggering the transformation of forest ecosystems in most places. This means that very few forests will either not be strongly affected by climate change, or will not require immediate management action to reduce their vulnerability to climate change

      Forest owners and managers across Europe are already strongly aware of climate change and are concerned with its impacts. This awareness needs to be increasingly translated into sufficient and tangible adaptation actions and resilience-enhancing forest management practices. For that, technical knowledge and information as well as targeted regulatory and financial incentives and support need to be developed. This Strategy aims to address these issues to support forest owners and managers in their efforts, scale up best practices and ensure an increase in the quantity and quality of EU’s forest cover for decades to come.

      Forest management practices that preserve and restore biodiversity lead to more resilient forests that can deliver on their socio-economic and environmental functions. Therefore all forests should be increasingly managed so that they are sufficiently biodiverse, taking into account the differences in natural conditions, biogeographic regions and forest typology. There are significant opportunities for win-win measures, which simultaneously improve forest productivity, timber production, biodiversity, carbon sink function, healthy soil properties and climate resilience. A greater diversity of forest ecosystems and species, and the use of well-adapted genetic resources and ecosystem-based approaches to forest management can enhance long‐term adaptability and forests’ capacity to recover and self-organise.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      In addition, certain management practices that support biodiversity and resilience, are essential in this context, such as the creation or maintenance at stand and landscape level of genetically and functionally diverse, mixed‐species forests, especially with more broadleaves and deciduous trees and with species with different biotic and abiotic sensitivities and recovery mechanisms following disturbances, instead of monocultural plantations. Also, management practices like uneven-aged and continuous-cover forestry, sufficient quantities of deadwood, regulation of wildlife densities and the establishment of protected habitat patches or set aside areas in production forests help ensure long-term environmental and socio-economic viability of forests. In addition, forest related risk management practices, such as integrated landscape fire management systems will increase forest resilience against wildfires, pests, diseases and create other positive spill over effects. Such practices provide an ‘insurance policy’ and safeguard that forests can continue to provide their full and multifunctional set of goods and services in a variable and uncertain future.
     </span>

    <p class="Normal">
     <span>

      Taking care of forests soil is particularly important, as there is a strong interdependence between trees and the soil on which they grow. For trees to thrive, tree roots need to obtain all essential elements and nutrients from the soil. Therefore, the soil properties and soil ecosystem services must be protected as the very foundation of healthy and productive forests. As an example, undue use of unsuitable machinery that cause negative environmental impacts such as soil compaction should be avoided.

      A common understanding of sustainable forest management has been agreed upon in the  Pan-European Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests (‘Forest Europe’), comprising voluntary principles, guidelines and indicators, which are used by the signatories to monitor the progress of their forests. Sustainable forest management means the
     </span>
     <span>
      stewardship and use of forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems.

     <span>
      In order to better respond to new challenges and needs, and in light of the increasing role of forests in the delivery of the EU’s commonly agreed climate and biodiversity objectives, the sustainable forest management framework will have to be  enhanced, notably as regards criteria relating to ecosystem health, biodiversity and climate change so that it can become a more detailed screening tool to determine and compare different management approaches, their impact and the overall state of EU forests. The sustainable forest management already covers several relevant indicators, such as deadwood and species diversity, but it does not yet define thresholds or ranges as benchmarks for the desirable condition.

      Therefore, building on the Forest Europe sustainable forest management criteria, the Commission, together with the Member States and in close cooperation with different forest stakeholders, will identify additional indicators as well as thresholds or ranges for sustainable forest management concerning forest ecosystem conditions, such as health, biodiversity and climate objectives. In thorough consultation with the Member States, the Commission will assess how these could  best be used, in respect of the subsidiarity principle and starting on a voluntary basis, to allow for a better comparative understanding of the overall sustainability of forests within the EU and demonstrate the contribution of sustainable forest management to EU objectives, in particular those related to climate, biodiversity and circular economy.

It is important to capitalise on this potential, as enhanced afforestation is also among the most effective climate change and disaster risk mitigation strategies in the forest sector, and can create substantial job opportunities, e.g. in relation to collecting and cultivating of seeds, planting seedlings, and ensuring their development, as well as providing socio-economic benefits to local communities. Also, exposure to green and forested areas can greatly benefit people’s physical and mental health.

      Strengthened forest protection and restoration and more biodiversity-friendly sustainable forest management are the right thing to do and will help to ensure the resilience and productive capacity of forests for decades to come. However, it has to be acknowledged that this will not happen without the motivation, engagement and action of European forest owners and managers – the principal caretakers of forests. The right thing to do must also be economically viable and best practices show that this can be the case.

      In publicly owned forests it is only reasonable for Member States to strengthen forest protection and restoration efforts to achieve the commonly agreed increased EU climate and biodiversity ambition and to ensure the transition to a climate-neutral economy. The Strategy acts against the trend of decreasing net removals from land in the EU, namely from forests, over the past 10 years. Reversing this trend is a precondition for achieving the EU’s agreed increased climate and biodiversity ambition and ensuring forests’ resilience to climate change so that forests can deliver on their multiple functions. This will require a series of initiatives highlighted in this strategy, such as forest protection and restoration, enhancement of sustainable forest management practices that retain carbon in the forest ecosystem including the soil, prioritising the cascading use of wood, and initiatives for forest regeneration and sustainable re- and afforestation.

      Yet, private forest owners and managers, especially of small holdings, often depend on forests directly for their livelihoods and today their main income comes from the supply of wood. The other benefits, especially the provision of ecosystem services, are rarely or never rewarded. This has to change.
     </span>
     <span>
      Forest owners and managers need drivers and financial incentives to be able to provide, in addition to wood and non-wood materials and products, also ecosystem services through forest protection and restoration and to increase the resilience of their forests through the adoption of most climate and biodiversity friendly forest management practices.
     </span>
     <span>
      This is particularly important in parts of Europe that have been hit by climate change earlier and harder than anticipated and where rural areas have suffered from the loss of income, livelihoods and even lives due to forest disasters.

      As to EU policies, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), through the national Rural Development Programs, already provides financial support for forests and forest management, namely for adaptation and resilience to climate-related risks. In 2014-2020, the CAP forestry measures committed EUR 6,7 billion in support of EU policy targets, mostly for afforestation (27%), prevention of forests fires and disasters (24%) and investments on resilience, ecological and social functions (19%). Yet, the uptake of forestry measures has been low, and decreased substantially along the programming period. This is for example due to the lack of necessary knowledge to manage the administrative procedures to request access to the funds, coupled with insufficient attractiveness of the premium and the lack of capacity building support through advisory services, as well as limited guidance on how to implement forest based adaptation activities and measures to climate change in order to prevent and reduce risks (e.g. wildfires, soil erosion, diseases, floods).

      Carbon farming schemes can be promoted via public policies and private initiatives. In addition, public support can also take the form of pure national financing under State aid guidelines, in particular under the EU agricultural and forestry guidelines, currently under review, that cover a wide range of forestry measures, including for example investment aid to improve the resilience and environmental value of forest ecosystems or aid for forest-environment and climate services and forest conservation. The Commission is exploring how to facilitate the use of national funds for forestry measures and target them better for ecosystem services in the forthcoming revision of the State aid guidelines.

Carbon farming can hence constitute a potential channel to achieve and implement targets underlying the present Strategy.

      Today the information concerning the status of forests in the EU, their social and economic value, as well as the pressures they face and ecosystem services they provide, is patchy.

      comprehensive reporting requirements exist. In addition, there are challenges related to the use of remote sensing data together with ground-based data (i.e. lack of interoperability, common definitions, ambiguity in data interpretation, lack of long and comparable very high resolution time-series, limitations of the current standard forest products from Copernicus). Also, there is insufficient planning for the forests, which would address in a coordinated manner and provide a comprehensive picture of the multifunctionality of forests in the EU, especially regarding climate mitigation and adaptation, ecological condition of forests,
     </span>
     <span>
      forest damage prevention and control,
     </span>
     <span>
      and forest biomass demand and supply for different socio-economic purposes. Combined with the need for more detailed sustainable forest management indicators and thresholds on certain climate and biodiversity aspects, this leads to a situation where, on the one hand, Member States have agreed at EU level to rely to a great extent on forests and forest-based bioeconomy in the EU’s transition to a climate-neutral economy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      On the other hand, there are several scattered monitoring and reporting mechanisms, but no strategic framework, which would bring these together and make it possible to comprehensively and jointly with Member States demonstrate that the EU is on the right track and that the forests can actually deliver on their multiple demands and functions.

      Monitoring has to be done with high spatial and temporal granularity. Timeliness is particularly important also due to the rapid unfolding of forest natural disturbances. The framework will

     <span>
      The wider contribution of forests to the European Green Deal objectives, as presented in the Strategy, including for climate, biodiversity and sustainable bioeconomy, necessitates a more inclusive and better coordinated EU forest governance structure, reflecting all the objectives of the new EU Forest Strategy and their interlinkages. Reinforced coordination of different policies should be ensured and a multidisciplinary exchange should be facilitated, with the involvement a wide variety of experts and stakeholders. Given the increasing interest of the European public in the future of EU’s forests, transparency of the governance should also be guaranteed so that everyone can follow how the Commission and the Member States are assisted in delivering on the objectives of the new EU Forest Strategy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      In this spirit, the Commission will propose an EU forest governance system that promotes policy coherence and synergies between the different functions a sustainable and climate neutral European economy requires forests to deliver, and allow for an inclusive space for Member States, forest owners and managers, industry, academia and civil society to discuss forest policy matters, while avoiding overlapping structures.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Regarding the dialogue with the Member States, building on the extensive experience of and cooperation within the Standing Forestry Committee and the Working Group on Forest and Nature, the Commission will propose an updated governance that brings these two groups together into a single expert group with a mandate reflecting all the environmental, social and economic objectives of the new EU Forest Strategy and membership ensuring that multiple Member State representatives from different Ministries are members of this group. To make this happen and avoid the creation of an additional structure, the Commission will work with Member States to revise the Standing Forestry Committee rules of procedure, or identify other measures as necessary. Also better synergies with the Expert Group on Forest-based Industries and Sector-related Issues will be established.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Regarding the engagement with civil society, forest owners and managers, industry and academia, the Commission will take a similar approach and build on the experience of the existing Civil Dialogue Group on Forestry and Cork and the Working Group on Forest and Nature, creating one group with a revised mission statement, broader membership and focus on the implementation of the new EU Forest Strategy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      The Commission will ensure regular joint meetings between the two groups, at least twice a year, and commit to full transparency of the discussions. The Commission encourages also Member States to establish broad multi-stakeholder dialogue platforms to discuss and inform European, national and local forest policies.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Such reinforced governance structure will allow to strengthen the dialogue, break silos and fully reflect, in the spirit of the European Green Deal and the new EU Forest Strategy, the synergies between rural development, sustainable forest bioeconomy and the EU’s increased climate and biodiversity ambition.

      Forests and the forest-based sector is an essential part of Europe’s transition to a modern, climate neutral, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The commitments and actions proposed in this strategy will deliver growing, healthy, diverse and resilient EU forests and ensure their significant contribution to our climate and biodiversity ambitions, thriving livelihoods in rural areas and beyond, and a sustainable forest bioeconomy. The strategic approach to monitoring, decentralised planning and management set out in this strategy will help ensure that forests can deliver on these multiple functions, in full respect for the principle of subsidiarity and Member States’ competence. The strategy recognises the central role of forests, foresters and the entire forest-based value chain for meeting the European Green Deal objectives, and implementation of the strategy will be underpinned by a strong and inclusive governance framework that allows all parties involved to engage and shape the future of forests in the EU. The Commission will ensure that the strategy is implemented in close coherence with other policy initiatives, including those adopted under the European Green Deal and proposals presented as part of the Fit-for-55 package.

      The Commission invites all stakeholders to engage in a broad debate on the future of EU forests. Citizens and communities are encouraged to actively take part in implementing the pledge of planting at least 3 billion additional trees by 2030. The Commission invites the European Parliament and the Council to endorse this strategy. To ensure full political ownership of the strategy, the Commission will suggest a standing progress point at the Council and at the European Parliament. It will review the strategy by 2025 to assess progress and whether further action is needed to meet its objectives.

       The cascading principle was already enshrined in the EU Forest Strategy 2014-2020. Under this principle, wood is used in the following order of priorities: 1) wood-based products, 2) extending their service life, 3) re-use, 4) recycling, 5) bio-energy and 6) disposal.

       Harvested wood product categories include 1) sawn wood, 2) wood panels and 3) paper. In GHG mitigation they have, by default, a first decay function with different half live values (35, 25 and 2 years). This way paper decays much faster (has a much lower mitigation potential over time) than the other categories. Anything that does not fall within these category/uses is instantaneously oxidized.

       Wood-based constructions products have an average market share of 2.4% in the EU (representing a total EU consumption of 26.2Mm3, or 15.7M tonnes of material), whereas non-metallic minerals constitute the bulk of materials used in the construction sector (market share of 93%). This market share varies widely between Member States: front-runners such as Finland or Sweden reach a market share above 10%, while most MS display a market share lower than 2%.

       Woody bioenergy in the EU is largely (49%) based on residues and wastes from logging and timber processing (e.g. branches and tops, sawdust, waste wood). The remaining 37% is supplied from so-called ‘primary biomass sources’, including low-quality stemwood and thinnings (20%), half of which is stemwood (10%) is derived from coppice while 4% per cent would be supplied by industrial quality stemwood.
      </span>
      <span>
      </span>
      <span>
       The remaining 14% is uncategorised in the reported statistics, meaning it is not classified as either a primary or secondary source, however in light of analysis of the woody biomass flows, the source is more likely to be primary wood.

      <span>
       is an example of such practices. It seeks multifunctional forests by combining biodiversity (even in planted forests), carbon stock preservation and timber-related revenues. Despite not having a universally accepted definition yet, closer-to-nature forestry is a concept discussed by private and public organisations, both in within the EU and globally.

       The Forest Focus Regulation (2152/2003) has been in force during 2003-2007, and it contributed to the “establishment of a scheme on monitoring of forests and environmental interactions to protect the Community’s forests”. The scheme was built on the achievements of two previous Council regulations for monitoring the impacts of atmospheric pollution (

       Copernicus Sentinel data or products and artificial intelligence are already used at European level and Member State level, e.g. to provide continuous forest inventories in Portugal, identify land use (changes) as well as check upon the health status of trees in support of forest managers and the pulp and paper industry. In Sweden, information coming from satellite imagery has allowed the detection of illegal cutting, which are now rare, and of poor management practices, since 2000. In Romania, a ‘smart forest’ project is being implemented in a primary forest to alert forest guards on potential illegal logging. Such examples are no longer the exception, and they drive forest management into the digital era.
