Raising the 2030 ambition now helps give certainty to policymakers and investors, so that decisions made in the coming years do not lock in emission levels inconsistent with the EU’s objective to be climate neutral by 2050. The 2030 target is in line with the Paris Agreement objective to keep the global temperature increase to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5°C.

      In order to follow the pathway set in the European Climate Law and deliver this increased level of ambition for 2030, the Commission has reviewed the climate and energy legislation currently in place, which would likely only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 and by 60% by 2050.

      (‘ESR’) in order to align its contribution towards delivering the increased ambition for 2030. In December 2020, the European Council called for delivering the target collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, preserving EU’s competitiveness and taking account of Member States’ different starting points, specific national circumstances and emission reduction potential. It gave further guidance on key elements for a revised 2030 climate and energy policy framework. To achieve at least 55% greenhouse gas emission reductions economy wide, the sectors under the Effort Sharing Regulation will need to step up efforts. The impact assessment supporting the Climate Target Plan indicated that overall reductions would need to increase by around 10 percentage points from the current ESR target of -30% compared to 2005. The need to review the ESR, decide on its scope and increase ambition were already elaborated in the Climate Target Plan.

      reduction in emissions covered by 2030 compared to 2005, coherent with an EU economy-wide emission reduction target of at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990. The ESR establishes binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for Member States which collectively deliver this reduction. I
     </span>

      . Even though this would mean outperforming the contribution of -30% referred to above, this would still be an insufficient contribution to an overall target of at least -55% compared to 1990, in line with the European Climate Law agreement. Therefore, the general objective of this initiative is to revise the ESR so that it contributes to the 2030 climate ambition to reach at least 55% net greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030 below 1990 levels in a cost-effective and coherent way while taking into account the need for a just transition and the need for all sectors to contribute to the EU’s climate efforts. The aim is to achieve a gradual and balanced trajectory towards climate neutrality by 2050.

      The ‘Fit for 55’ package together with the Next Generation EU instrument and the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027 will help achieving the twin green and digital transitions that Europe is aiming for. The combination of these policies and EU financial support will address the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerate the shift to a clean and sustainable economy, linking climate action and economic growth while reaching climate neutrality by 2050. Overall, the EU budget (MFF) 2021-2027 and the Next Generation EU package will ensure a 30% climate mainstreaming expenditure target. As regards specifically the Resilience and Recovery Facility under Next Generation EU, each national recovery and resilience plan will have to include a minimum of 37% of expenditure related to climate investments. Cohesion policy will contribute to climate expenditure with 100% of the Just Transition Fund, and at least 37% of the Cohesion Fund and 30% of the European Regional Development Fund. These funds can heavily support the investments and reforms identified in the National Energy and Climate Plans, adopted based on the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action

      The legal basis for this proposal is Article 192 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In accordance with Article 191 and 192(1) TFEU, the European Union shall contribute to the pursuit, inter alia, of the following objectives: preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment; promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change.

    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Climate change is a trans-boundary problem, which cannot be solved by national or local action alone. Coordination of climate action must be taken at European level and, where possible, at global level. EU action is justified on grounds of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty of the European Union. Since 1992, the European Union has worked to develop joint solutions and drive forward global action to tackle climate change. More specifically, action at EU level will provide for cost effective delivery of the 2030 and long-term emission reduction objectives while ensuring fairness and environmental integrity. Articles 191 to 193 of the TFEU confirm and specify EU competencies in the area of climate change.

The remaining 276 responses were provided by business associations, businesses, individuals, public authorities and trade unions. The great majority of respondents agreed that the sectors covered by the ESR should deliver additional reductions and that Member States should step-up their efforts and pursue more ambitious targets. A majority of respondents were in favour of parallel coverage of ESR and ETS in case of an extension of the ETS, to buildings and road transport, with a large majority of NGOs and citizens’ in favour of this option. A smaller but significant share of respondents were in favour of reducing the sectoral scope of the ESR with a much more limited majority of private sector replies in favour of this option (especially coming from the energy sector).

      As other proposals and impact assessments attached to the “Fit for 55” policy package, this proposal makes also use of a collection of integrated modelling tools covering the entire greenhouse gas emissions of the EU economy. These tools are used to produce a set of core scenarios reflecting self-consistent policy packages aligned with the increased 2030 climate target, building upon the scenarios developed for the 2030 Climate Target Plan. The scenarios are based on the updated EU Reference 2020 Scenario (REF 2020)

      Within options 1 and 2, the impact assessment also addresses the appropriate level of increase of the targets on emission reductions, namely whether the increase should be strong or moderate, the distribution of efforts among Member States and their contribution to the collective target, the starting point of the annual allocations trajectories, and the functioning of the ETS and LULUCF flexibilities.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      So far, the EU ETS Directive, the ESR and the LULUCF Regulation together have covered the greenhouse emissions of different parts of the economy, each of them defining the contribution of the covered sectors to the overall target. Specific questions arise from the extension of carbon pricing, an important tool to combat greenhouse gas emissions, to new sectors.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      The creation of a new emission trading for road transport and buildings warranted the consideration of the scope of the Effort Sharing Regulation itself, taking into account the effectiveness, cost-efficiency and fairness of the instrument and the climate policy architecture as a whole. Similarly, a change in the scope of the LULUCF Regulation towards a Land Use instrument could also impact the ESR scope. However, the LULUCF proposal only foresees national targets for the land sector after 2030, and therefore, does not impact the ESR proposal, which has a time scope limited to 2030. Additionally, different options for the scope of the ESR have been considered and assessed in the impact assessment, notably whether or not a sector is included both in the ESR and in emission trading, and/or a land use instrument would impact the achievement of the overall EU target by 2030.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      The application of emissions trading to sectors such as buildings and road transport will cover around half of the emissions of today’s Effort Sharing Regulation. As with the current ETS, such a system will integrate the price of CO2 in economic and financial decisions and will be an important tool to incentivise cost effective action by business and consumers in these sectors across all Member States. At the same time, a carbon price on its own would not deliver the required transformation in the sectors concerned in an efficient manner. The 2030 Climate Target Plan concluded that there is a clear need for complementary and targeted policies. These can address market failures and split incentives, accelerate technological change and develop the required infrastructure in a coordinated way (e.g. for building renovation, electrification and hydrogen technology for industry).
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Therefore, it would be premature to leave the aimed decrease in emissions from buildings and road transport exclusively to emission trading. Such an option will deserve proper consideration in a future review of the ESR, building on the lessons learned from the functioning of emission trading for these two sectors.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      The preferred option is to increase ambition in the ESR, in line with the cost efficient projections, to achieve the overall climate ambition for 2030 set out in the 2030 Climate Target Plan. The extension of emission trading to new sectors – road transport and building- while keeping them under the ESR scope, is seen as contributing to the achievement of the ESR target, and not as a substitution of it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Increasing the national targets under the ESR requires revisiting fairness and cost efficiency within the instrument. As regards fairness, the assessment concludes that an update of the target setting approach based on GDP per capita is still appropriate, while applying a limited amount of targeted corrections to address cost efficiency concerns. Overall this will drive towards convergence of per capita emissions in these sectors across the EU.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      In view of ensuring maximum cost-efficiency, all existing flexibilities are expected to be used with the increased ambition, reflected in a 40% EU target for ESR. The flexibility instruments, both in their scale and functioning, are deemed to be appropriate to ensure enhanced cost efficiency of the overall policy.

      New binding national limits, expressed in annual emission allocations, progressively leading to the 2030 target of each Member State will need to be established for the years 2023 to 2030. The emission allocations for the years 2023, 2024 and 2025 will be calculated on the basis of the greenhouse gas emissions data for the years 2005 and 2016 to 2018 as reviewed by the Commission in accordance with Article 4(3) of the ESR. For greater accuracy, the calculation of the annual emission allocations for the years 2026 to 2030 will be based on the average of the greenhouse gas emissions of each Member State during the years 2021, 2022 and 2023 following a comprehensive review of the national inventory data to be carried out by the Commission in 2025.

      Furthermore, the Commission is to carry out, in 2027, a comprehensive review of the national inventory data for the purpose of compliance with the ESR, as provided for in Article 38 of the Governance Regulation.

      This provision in the European Climate Law is without prejudice to the revision of Union legislation. The proposed increase in ambition of the LULUCF Regulation, together with splitting the existing LULUCF flexibility for use in each of the 5 year compliance periods, reduces the likelihood of not meeting the requirements of the Climate Law. Still, allowing for flexibility from the ESR sector into the LULUCF sectors and limited flexibility vice versa, is beneficial in order to enable Member States to comply effectively with their individual obligations.

      The ESR sets emission reduction targets for Member States at national level. It is thus for Member States to decide how to achieve such targets (for reasons of subsidiarity). This proposal, while revising the targets to be achieved by each Member States by 2030, does not impose additional administrative burden on national administrations, as main actors in this regard targeted by the ESR.

      BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS

    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      A good implementation of the proposal amending the ESR will be crucial for the achievement of its objectives and the objectives set in the European Climate Law. The increase in the ESR targets will require additional measures at national level and Member States, will need to revise and implement more stringent climate action strategies. Therefore there is a need for capacity building support measures to be implemented throughout five years (2023-2027) allowing Member States to adjust to a more demanding framework. The total estimated cost of the support measures is EUR 1 750 000.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      The proposal also revises the LULUCF flexibility set in Article 7 of the ESR and creates a new voluntary reserve, the additional reserve, to help Member States reaching their individual targets, allowing them to use non used net removals generated in the period 2026-2030, subject to the condition that the Union 55% emission reduction target is reached in 2030 with a maximum contribution of net removals set at 225 MtCO

      Transparent and regular reporting on Member State obligations coupled with robust compliance checks are fundamental elements ensuring progress in delivering the EU long-term emission reduction commitments. The initiative maintains the compliance regime of the ESR and continues to rely on the robust monitoring, reporting and verification framework provided in the Governance Regulation. The Commission will use inter alia the information submitted and reported by Member States under the Governance Regulation as a basis for its regular assessment of progress. This includes information on greenhouse gas emissions, policies and measures, projections and adaptation. The Commission will also make use of this information for the Environmental Implementation Reviews and the monitoring of the Environment Action Programmes. Information obtained from Member States may be complemented by systematic atmospheric observations through in situ as well as remote sensing observations, such as those provided by Copernicus.

      The effectiveness of the proposal in achieving the revised 2030 targets depends of the capacity of Member States to adjust their plans and strategies to a more vigorous response to the challenge of climate change. In this context the Commission will put in place capacity building measures to support Member States in their efforts to incorporate the revised targets into their national climate plans and strategies, including the National Energy and Climate Plans.

It also aims to protect, conserve and enhance the Union's natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. At the same time, this transition affects women and men differently and has a particular impact on some disadvantaged groups, such as older people, persons with disabilities and persons with a minority racial or ethnic background. It must therefore be ensured that the transition is just and inclusive, leaving no one behind.

      For that purpose, the greenhouse gas emission reduction target for 2030 needs to be revised for each Member State. The revision of the greenhouse gas emission reduction target should use the same methodology that was followed when Regulation (EU) 2018/842 was first adopted, where the national contributions were determined in consideration of the different capacities and cost-efficiency opportunities in Member States so to ensure a fair and balanced distribution of the effort. The reduction of the maximum greenhouse gas emissions for each Member State in 2030 should thus be determined in relation to the level of its 2005 reviewed greenhouse gas emissions covered by this Regulation, excluding verified greenhouse gas emissions from installations that operated in 2005 and which were only included in the emission trading system of the Union after 2005.

      As a consequence, it will be necessary to set, as from the year of adoption of this Regulation, new binding national limits, expressed in annual emission allocations, progressively leading to the 2030 target of each Member State, while keeping in force the annual limits established for the years preceding it as set in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2020/2126

      The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the Union’s economy and its level of emissions to a degree that cannot yet be fully quantified. On the other hand, the Union is deploying its largest stimulus package ever, also having a potential impact on the level of emissions. Due to those uncertainties, it is appropriate to review the emissions data in 2025 and, if necessary, readjust the annual emission allocations.

      It is therefore appropriate to update in 2025 the annual emission allocations for the years 2026 to 2030. This should be based on a comprehensive review of the national inventory data carried out by the Commission in order to determine the average of the greenhouse gas emissions of each Member State during the years 2021, 2022 and 2023.

      Under Regulation (EU) 2018/842, the cancellation of a limited quantity of emission allowances in the European Union emission trading system may be taken into account for some Member States’ compliance under Regulation (EU) 2018/842.
     </span>
     <span>
      Given
     </span>
     <span>
      the particular structure of Malta’s economy, the national reduction target of that Member State based on Gross Domestic Product per capita is significantly above its cost-effective reduction potential
     </span>
     <span>
      ,
     </span>
     <span>
      is is therefore appropriate to increase Malta’s access to
     </span>
     <span>
      that flexibility, without compromising the 2030 target of the Union on emission reductions.

      In addition to that flexibility, a limited quantity of net removals and net emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (‘LULUCF’) may be taken into account for Member States’ compliance under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 (‘the LULUCF flexibility’). In order to ensure that sufficient mitigation efforts are deployed until 2030, it is appropriate to limit the use of the LULUCF flexibility by separating the use of such flexibility into two separate time periods, each capped by a limit corresponding to half of the maximum amount of total net removals set out in Annex III to Regulation (EU) 2018/842. It is also appropriate to bring the title of Annex III in line with the amendment to Regulation (EU) 2018/841 carried out by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/268 of 28 October 2020

      . As a consequence, there is no longer a need for Regulation (EU) 2018/842 to provide for a legal basis allowing the Commission to adopt delegated acts to amend the title of its Annex III. Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 should therefore be deleted.

      Considering, the introduction of a strengthened compliance regime in Regulation (EU) 2018/841 as of 2026, it is appropriate to abolish the deduction of the greenhouse gas emissions generated by each Member State in the period from 2026 to 2030 in the land sector in excess of its removals. Article 9(2) should therefore be amended accordingly.

      The setting of more ambitious targets under Regulation (EU) 2018/841 will decrease the capacity of Member States to generate net removals that can be used for compliance under Regulation (EU) 2018/842. In addition, the split of the use of the LULUCF flexibility into two separate time periods, will further limit the availability of net removals for the purpose of compliance with Regulation (EU) 2018/842. As a result, some Member States may face challenges in meeting their targets under Regulation (EU) 2018/842, while some Member States, the same or other, may generate net removals that cannot be used for compliance with Regulation (EU) 2018/842. As long as the Union objectives as set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 are met, in particular with regard to the maximum limit of the contribution of net removals, it is appropriate to create a new voluntary mechanism, in the form of an additional reserve, that will help adhering Member States to comply with their obligations.

      Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this point 'added value of Union involvement' is the value resulting from Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.

       Climate change is a trans-boundary problem. Since the objective of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting individually, coordination of climate action at European level and, where possible, at global level is necessary and EU action is justified on grounds of subsidiarity. The EU and its Member States participate jointly in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Joint action allows the EU to address issues of both equity and efficiency, while reaching an ambitious environmental goal. Articles 191 to 193 of the TFEU confirm EU competencies in the area of climate change.

       The implementation and functioning of the Effort Sharing framework (first through Decision No 406/2009/EC, followed by the Effort Sharing Regulation - to be amended through this proposal) has resulted in Member States becoming more active in considering new measures to reduce emission in sectors and how to best design them.

       With existing national policies and measures implemented, EU-27 total emissions are projected to be reduced by 30% in 2030 according to aggregated national greenhouse gas projections. In 2019, all Member States prepared their final integrated National Energy and Climate Plans. With the implementation of the planned measures or stated ambitions in the final NECPs, the overall greenhouse gas reduction of the EU is estimated at 41%, thus reaching the current at least 40% reduction target.

       The ‘fit for 55’ package and the Next Generation EU and the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027, will help achieving the twin green and digital transitions that Europe is aiming for. The initiative is also consistent with the Union policies on a clean and circular economy, sustainable and smart mobility, the Farm to Fork Strategy, EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, and the upcoming action plan on zero-pollution ambition as well as its stance in the international arena and its Green Deal Diplomacy.
