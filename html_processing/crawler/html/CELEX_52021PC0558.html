       to put forward a comprehensive plan to increase the European Union’s target for 2030 towards 55% in a responsible way. The Climate Target Plan is also in line with the Paris Agreement' objective to keep the global temperature increase to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to keep it to 1,5°C. In December 2020, the European Council endorsed a binding EU target of a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.

       The European Council concluded that climate ambition needed to be raised in a manner that would spur sustainable economic growth, create quality jobs, deliver health and environmental benefits for citizens of the Union, and contribute to the long-term global competitiveness of the Union’s economy by promoting innovation in green technologies.
      </span>
      <span>
       On 22 April 2021, the European Parliament and the Council came to a provisional political agreement to achieve at least a 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030. This sets the framework for action to reduce GHG emissions over the coming decades, but needs to be implemented through specific legislation to ensure those reductions occur.
      </span>
      <span>
       Projections indicate that, if current policies are fully implemented, greenhouse gas emissions reductions
      </span>
      <span>
       by 2030 would be around 45% compared to 1990 levels, when excluding land use emissions and absorptions, and around 47%, when including land use. The 2030 Climate Target Plan therefore previews a set of actions required across all sectors of the economy and the launch of revisions of the key legislative instruments to achieve this increased ambition.

       announced a ‘Fit for 55’ package to reduce GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030, and achieve a climate-neutral Europe by 2050. This package will cover a wide range of policy areas including energy efficiency, renewables, land use, energy taxation, effort sharing and emissions trading.

       . The Energy Efficiency Directive has led to the Union’s current energy efficiency policy to capture the cost-effective energy saving opportunities. In December 2018, the Energy Efficiency Directive was amended as part of the 'Clean Energy for All Europeans package’, in particular to include a new headline 2030 Union energy efficiency target of at least 32,5% (compared to projected energy use in 2030), and to extend and strengthen the energy savings obligation beyond 2020.

      <span>
       created by the Covid-19 pandemic, the sum of national contributions communicated by Member States in the National Energy Climate Plans (NECP) falls short of the Union’s level of ambition of 32,5% in 2030. The contributions collectively would lead to a reduction of 29,4% for final energy consumption (FEC) and 29,7% for primary energy consumption (PEC) compared to the projections from the 2007 reference scenario for 2030. This would translate in a collective ambition gap of 2,8 percentage points for primary energy consumption and 3.1 percentage points for final energy consumption for EU27. This gap also affects the level of efforts needed to reach the higher ambition of energy efficiency targets. The CTP Impact Assessment concludes that it is unlikely that the necessary higher levels of energy efficiency needed would be achieved through market forces, current market organisation and technology development alone, meaning that further efforts are needed. According to the impact assessment

       accompanying this Directive, energy efficiency improvements will need to be significantly stepped from the current ambition level of 32,5%.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       The higher ambition level requires a stronger promotion of energy efficiency, wherever cost-effective, in all areas of the energy system and in all relevant sectors, where activity affects energy demand, such as the transport, water and agriculture sectors. Addressing the water-energy nexus is particularly important, due to increasing water and energy needs, or increasing pressure on water resources due to climate change.

       The Energy Efficiency Directive is an important element to progress towards climate neutrality by 2050, under which energy efficiency is to be treated as an energy source in its own right. The key role of energy efficiency is supported by the energy efficiency first principle. It is recognised as a guiding principle of the Union energy policy and should be taken into account across all sectors, going beyond the energy system, at all levels, including in the financial sector. Energy efficiency solutions should be considered as the first option in planning and investment decisions, when setting new rules for the supply side and other policy areas. The principle has been recognised as a key element of the Strategy for Energy Sector Integration

       While the energy savings potential remains large in all sectors, there is a particular challenge related to transport, as it is responsible for 30% of final energy consumption, and to buildings, since 75% of the Union building stock has a poor energy performance. Another important sector to which increasing attention is being paid is the information and communications technology (ICT) sector, which is responsible for 5-9% of the world's total electricity use and more than 2% of all emissions.

       In 2018, the energy consumption of data centres in the Union was 76,8 TWh. This is expected to rise to 98,5 TWh by 2030 a 28% increase.

      The household sector makes up around a quarter of all final energy consumption in the Union. The behaviour of consumers and citizens has an important impact on this energy consumption and the EED contains several provisions that support the empowerment of citizens and consumers. The lack of strong consumer behaviour and consumer empowerment aspects in promoting energy efficiency, in particular at more local levels, results in insufficient incentives for consumers to realise energy efficiency improvements and to tackle high upfront costs and

Energy poverty levels across Member States will be in the spotlight as more Europeans may struggle to afford access to essential energy, particularly with rising energy costs and unemployment. Also medium-income households might be at increasing risk of facing energy poverty in the near future, as already today the majority of households affected by energy poverty are (lower) middle-income households. Energy efficiency has been identified as the most effective solution to alleviate energy poverty and to overcome some of the potential negative distributional impacts of pricing measures.

       This proposal for the Energy Efficiency Directive Recast sets a framework for other energy efficiency policies by laying down the energy efficiency targets and setting the main cross-sectoral measures as well as more specific ones. It targets energy savings in the public sector including via obligations to renovate public buildings annually and taking into account energy efficiency in procurement of goods, services, works and buildings. Its particular aim at public buildings is complementary to the EPBD, which sets the standards and specific technical obligations related to buildings. The public sector serves the population at large, including the vulnerable customers and those in risk of energy poverty, thus ensuring that no one is left behind in line with the objectives of the European Green Deal. The special focus on public sector in the Energy Efficiency Directive is vital to undertake its exemplary role in promoting energy efficiency. The Commission has started the review of the EPBD with a view to come forward with a proposal towards the end of 2021. While at this point in time it is not possible to prejudge the outcome of that review, this proposal respects the specific role of the EPBD in setting cost-optimal energy performance requirements, while strengthening the EED provisions pertaining to the exemplary role of public bodies, notably regarding buildings (Article 5 and Article 6), and public procurement (Article 7), which provides the necessary horizontal framework for action.

       The Energy Efficiency Directive sets the framework for heating and cooling planning in terms of identifying the energy efficiency and renewable energy potential by the Members States. It also provides for monitoring policies and measures to exploit this potential. These policies and measures directly support the achievement of the renewable target in the heating and cooling sector target set out in Article 24 of the Renewable Energy Directive. For example, a revised definition of efficient district heating and cooling (Article 2(43) of the Energy Efficiency Directive) would directly promote the deployment of renewable energy in district heating and cooling. Vice versa, these sub-targets would contribute to the achievement of the energy efficiency objectives of the Energy Efficiency Directive.

       Furthermore, the planning measures for the heating and cooling sector under the Energy Efficiency Directive will be synchronised with the timeline of the NECPs. This facilitates higher consistency between the NECPs, the Comprehensive Assessments and the assessments of the potential of energy from renewable sources and of the use of waste heat and cold in the heating and cooling sector pursuant to Article 15(7) of the Renewable Energy Directive.

      Changes to the policy architecture of the Energy Efficiency Directive interact with existing and planned policies and measures, including pricing and non-pricing mechanisms and measures. The Energy Efficiency Directive, which addresses existing market barriers hampering energy efficiency, works hand-in-hand with the introduction of emissions trading for fuels used in buildings, which will shorten payback time of energy efficiency investments and strengthen the business case for energy efficiency measures across the Union. The Climate Target Plan demonstrated that a mix of regulatory intervention and carbon pricing is needed to deliver the most cost effective pathway towards achieving the 55% GHG reduction target. Striking a balance between carbon pricing and the regulatory policies is crucial to achieve the increased climate target in a cost-efficient manner, while mitigating any impacts of carbon costs being passed on in particular on vulnerable customers and final users. At the same time, emissions trading will generate additional revenues from the allowance auctions that can be redistributed among Member States and within Member States in order to support vulnerable and energy poor end-users in paying their bills and carrying out building renovation.

      The ‘Fit for 55’ package brings together the relevant policy instruments that can contribute to the 55% GHG reduction target and aims to do so in a coherent and proportional manner among other relevant regulations and directives. This is notably the case for the Energy Efficiency Directive, the Renewable Energy Directive (REDII), the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), Land use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), energy taxation and CO2 emission standards for vehicles.

      The EED has important interlinkages with the Renewable Energy Directive, notably in relation to heating and cooling as both also contribute to achieving the objectivise of the Strategy for Energy Sector Integration. The EED provides strengthened framework for planning in terms of identifying the energy efficiency and renewable energy potential in heating and cooling, and requires that Members States implement policies and measures to exploit this potential. These policies and measures directly support the achievement of the renewable energy target in heating and cooling laid out in Article 23 of Renewable Energy Directive.

      The EU ETS establishes a cap on GHG emissions, which is declining over time. The ESR establishes binding annual GHG emissions targets for Member States targeting GHG emissions from sectors not covered by the EU ETS, including buildings, transport and agriculture. The ESR drives compliance with the Energy Efficiency Directive, in particular with the energy savings obligation. The additionality requirement under the energy savings obligation provides incentives to Member States to implement national policies and measures that exceed the minimum energy performance requirements levels set at Union level (e.g. stricter national building codes and programmes promoting higher classes of appliances).

      Before all measures and targets proposed under the `Fit for 55’ Package will fully take effect and relieve European citizens from dependencies from fossil fuels and increasing energy costs, during the transition period some action can lead to significant distributional effects. The extension of the EU ETS to the buildings and transport sectors is expected to result in increasing energy prices as fuel suppliers are likely to pass on carbon costs to consumers, and may thus affect vulnerable customers and final users relying on fossil fuels, or people at risk of energy poverty. Targeted measures to ease the transition both at European and at national level. The `Fit for 55 Package´ proposes specific measures under the EED, and a new funding instrument based on the revenues from the new ETS to mitigate the impact of higher costs for consumers as a result of the introduction of a carbon price in the road transport and building sectors. It is key to ensure that energy efficiency investments take place amongst the most vulnerable in our societies. Support measures to strengthen the energy savings obligation and to empower and protect vulnerable customers, households affected by or at risk of energy poverty, and, where applicable, people living in social housing, can help to mitigate these effects. A combined effect of the proposed measures under the EED and the new funding tool based on the revenues from emissions trading in the new sectors will help addressing the possible negative social effects in an effective manner and in the spirit of solidarity. Revenues from the EU ETS, including from emissions trading in the new sectors, will also remain available to Member States to finance measures intended to improve energy efficiency, district heating systems and insulation, or to provide financial support to lower- and middle-income households.

    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      To address the social impacts arising from the emissions trading for the two new sectors of buildings and road transport, a Social Climate Fund (‘the Fund’) is created. In order to ensure that the Union budget can sustain the additional expenditure for the Fund, the Commission puts forward in parallel to this Fund Regulation proposals to amend both the Regulation for the Multiannual Financial Framework for the years 2021 to 2027 and Council Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053 (‘the Own Resource Decision’). In particular, a part of the revenues from the emission trading for the road transport and buildings will accrue to the Union budget. The Fund should provide funding to Member States to support their measures and investments intended to increase energy efficiency of buildings, to carry out energy efficiency improvements, building renovation, and to decarbonise heating and cooling of buildings, including the integration of energy production from renewable energy sources and to finance zero- and low- emission mobility. Member States could also consider temporary direct support to vulnerable households alongside investments accelerating further structural change.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Moreover, in line with the Renovation Wave Strategy, the Union funding support to energy efficiency and buildings renovation investments that will help addressing or preventing energy poverty, is present in a number of new and existing programmes of the MFF and the Next Generation EU.

      Another key source of funding for energy efficiency investments is provided through the Recovery and Resilience Facility, which will make available to Member States a total of 672,5 euro billion between grants and loans. Within the overall target of 37% of the RRF funds to be dedicated to climate actions, Member States plan to spend significant amounts on buildings renovation investments, in line with the guidance from the European Commission, specifically targeting worst performing buildings and energy poor households.

    </p>
    <p class="Normal">

      The Cohesion Policy funds, within the overall climate target of 30% and through the thematic concentration on Policy Objective 2, will continue allocating important share of Union budget to energy efficiency and buildings renovation investments, while InvestEU, through the dedicated financial instruments and technical assistance, especially the ELENA Facility, will mobilise at scale private and public investments in the Member States.

      The Energy Efficiency Directive will create synergies with the measures of the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy. While leaving the full flexibility and discretion to the Member States regarding the choice of measures for achieving the reduction in energy use in transport, the Directive will incentives the uptake of energy efficiency measures in the transport sector.
     </span>
     <span>
      The Circular Economy Action Plan is also complementary to the EED. Designing products and infrastructures for longer lifetimes, or re-using and recycling raw materials, leads to lower energy consumption and GHG emissions along the life-cycle of products and infrastructures. The Renovation Wave Strategy puts focus on ensuring that Europe’s buildings are more energy-efficient, less carbon-intensive over their full life-cycle and more sustainable. Circular economy principles can help reduce pollution and materials-related greenhouse gas emissions of building renovation.

      Union level action is needed to ensure that Member States contribute to the EU level binding energy efficiency target and that it is collectively and cost-effectively met. Member States are required to define their own ambition levels, including trajectories that correspond to their national circumstances and context. The nature of the instrument and the fact that the energy efficiency target is not binding at national level respects the principle of subsidiarity. By taking into account the national context and specificities, Member States will retain the same level of flexibility in terms of selecting their policy mix, sectors and the approach to achieve the required energy savings by 2030.

      The underlying problems causing a shortfall in energy savings (compared to the optimal level from the perspective of society) are the same across the Union and are present everywhere. In view of the external costs of energy consumption (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions, air pollutant emissions, energy security), actions to increase energy efficiency and reduce energy use are likely to lead to benefits beyond national borders. For trans-boundary problems, Member State action is unlikely to lead to optimal outcomes. In the presence of a higher climate target, which requires a higher energy efficiency target, Union action must supplement and reinforce national and local action.

      Energy efficiency policies are a crucial mechanism to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to bringing enviromental, economic and social benefits such as better air quality, reduced energy bills and better health. The Union’s energy and climate targets for 2030 are collective targets.

      Concrete actions to reduce energy consumption need to be carried out at Member States’ level. Nevertheless, an effective framework for those actions is needed at Union level. A coordinated and harmonised approach at the Union level will enable and enhance Member States’ actions, and ensure the four freedoms. A common Union approach will help, for example, to create larger markets for European suppliers, workers and goods, and ensure that the same obligations and rules apply. This will protect and boost competition. A common approach at Union level will allow consumers to enjoy the same basic rights and to receive comparable and recognisable information across the Union. A common Union approach to energy efficiency will enable addressing specific common challenges such as the need to alleviate energy poverty.

      The experience from the implementation of the Energy Efficiency Directive has shown that a common Union framework is socially just, reduces costs, increases benefits from the internal market and allows national policy-makers to learn from each other. The Energy Efficiency Directive effectively complements and catalyses other national and Union measures. Policies adopted at Union level reflect the close interrelation of the policy areas of climate change, security of supply, sustainability, environment, internal market, social and economic development. Effects on the single market concerning growth, investments and jobs creation can thus be considered when policies and measures are being decided and implemented. This was supported by the Task Force of mobilising Member States efforts to reach 2020 energy efficiency targets, which called for a strong, targeted and common energy efficiency policy framework to attract the necessary investments, ensure the energy savings are achieved in a just and fair way.

      A common Union action will ensure that that the objectives of the policy are achieved collectively at the lowest possible cost. Therefore, to reach the overall targets collectively, the coordinated action at Union level can enable and enhance efforts at national level by ensuring a more harmonised approach, helping to create markets of scale for European suppliers, and ensuring that they are under the same obligations and rules.

      An Union-level framework will also provide more investor certainty. It will provide a general impetus across the whole single market to invest in more energy efficient products of all types. The definition of Union and national objectives gives a clear indication on how much efforts are expected in energy efficiency, and it helps defining the size of the market for energy efficient products and services. This will send a signal to suppliers and manufacturers to put more effort into product development in this regard.

      The Energy Efficiency Directive essentially sets the overall energy efficiency objective, but leaves the majority of actions to be taken to achieve this objective to the Member States. The application of the `Energy Efficiency First´ principle leaves flexibility to the Member States. The Energy Efficiency Directive sets binding energy efficiency targets at Union level, but will not establish binding targets at national level in the 2020 and 2030 perspective. Member States should establish their contribution to the collective achievement of the Union’s energy efficiency target taking into account the formula provided in the Energy Efficiency Directive. An obligation to achieve an annual reduction of the energy consumption in the public sector will ensure that the public sector fulfils its exemplary role, whereas Member States retain full flexibility regarding the choice of energy efficiency improvement measures to achieve the required reduction of the final energy consumption. In addition, the Energy Efficiency Directive will continue providing an annual rate of renovation required related to the floor area of buildings. The scope of this obligation is extended to buildings owned by all public bodies on the territory of a Member State. This measure shall ensure that Member States continue leading by example through upgrading the energy performance of buildings in their spheres, while retaining the flexibility regarding the choice of measures. Furthermore, the Energy Efficiency Directive will provide the necessary framework to ensure high energy efficiency performance of products, services, works and buildings purchased by public bodies, and to consider, where appropriate, wider sustainability, social, environmental and circular economy aspects. A harmonised approach, including considering energy efficiency aspects in tendering processes, will preserve competition, ensure long-term and cost-effective energy savings and allow for continuing markets of scale. The Energy Efficiency Directive will extend the energy savings by increasing the savings rate. Member States should continue achieving new annual energy savings from policy measures across all sectors. Since the energy savings obligation is an effective measure to improve energy efficiency in various sectors, it is also an effective tool to support Member States in the alleviation of energy poverty. Thus, the energy savings obligation will require Member States to achieve an individually calculated share of the total amount of energy savings required towards vulnerable customers and final users, people affected by energy poverty and, where applicable, people living in social housing. A harmonised approach can contribute to a just energy transition for all European citizens. The energy savings obligation retains full flexibility for Member States with regard to the types of policy measures, their size, scope and content. The Energy Efficiency Directive will ensure the same level of basic contractual rights for all European citizens regarding heating, cooling and domestic hot water. Whereas the Energy Efficiency Directive will require the implementation of certain basic contractual rights of customers, the national competences would not be restricted. One level playing field across the EU is also required with regard to consumer information and awareness raising activities. Member States are required to take appropriate measures, whereas the concrete design of such actions remain at their discretion. The Union -wide impacts of economic and health crisis show that a harmonised approach is also required to empower and protect vulnerable customers and final users and those affected by energy poverty.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      To ensure the same level of protection and empowerment, the Energy Efficiency Directive requires to implement and finance energy efficiency improvement measures as a priority among those people, which will also support Member States in mitigating distributional effects. Network of experts will facilitate Member States´ actions in this regard and should be established in all Member States. While requiring mandatory energy audits for large enterprises, as energy savings can be significant, Member States will retain flexibility to develop programmes to encourage SMEs to undergo energy audits. Regarding the heating and cooling sector, Member States retain their competences to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the potential for high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling, and may grant exemptions in the area of waste heat recovery through high-efficiency cogeneration or by supplying a district heating or cooling network. The Energy Efficiency Directive will allow Member States to introduce measures and procedures to promote cogeneration installations. To contribute to the creation of a single market, all Member States, National Regulatory Authorities, transmission and distribution system operators should apply the `Energy Efficiency First´ principle and remove all regulatory, technical and non-regulatory measures for energy efficiency improvements in the operation of energy networks. The development of a market for energy services to ensure the availability of both the demand for and the supply of energy services would remain subject to Member States´ discretion. The Energy Efficiency Directive would retain the flexibility for Member States to take action to identify and address regulatory and non-regulatory barriers for energy efficiency improvements. Member States and regions would be encouraged to make full use of the Structural and Investments Funds and other financing facilities to trigger investments in energy efficiency improvement measures, to alleviate energy poverty, and to mitigate any distributional effects on vulnerable customers and final users, people affected by energy poverty, and those living in social housing.

Member States would need to establish a database with public bodies, including their annual energy consumption. The proposed energy consumption reduction obligation leaves significant flexibility to Member States as to where and how energy savings could be achieved. Given the cost-benefits that would accrue from implementing savings measures, this effort is considered effective and not excessive. The Proposal also aims to address distributional impacts from the extension of emission trading to buildings and transport. Setting definitions and obligations notably in relation to heating and cooling would be proportionate to the additional energy savings and synergies with the other instruments that could be achieved in this sector. Proportionality of additional monitoring and reporting requirements depend on the balance between increased cost and savings achieved due to a better understanding of the impacts of relevant measures.

       The proposal combines a codification and an amendment of the Energy Efficiency Directive.

       To align the two processes, the revision and the codification processes, the Commission proposes a Recast of the Energy Efficiency Directive. The recasting technique contributes to simplifying Union legislation by allowing the adoption of a single legislative text, which simultaneously makes the desired amendment, codifies that amendment and previous ones the unchanged provisions of the earlier act, and repeals that act and previous amending acts. Therefore, a recast Directive is the appropriate instrument and is in line with the Commission’s commitment under paragraph 46 of the Inter-institutional Agreement on better law-making

      However, under business-as-usual, and even more so as a result of the adverse socio-economic impacts and income losses due to Covid-19 crisis, a large share of this energy efficiency and energy saving potential would remain unexploited, including due to market and regulatory failures, which prevent cost-effective energy efficiency investments and actions from taking place. Given the significant energy savings potential, further promotion of energy efficiency actions and the removal of continued existence of barriers to energy efficient behaviour, including for investments, are necessary.

      The evaluation shows that there seems to be a reluctance in the public sectors to include energy efficiency requirements systematically in procurement, mainly because purchase price. Thus, there is a scope for strengthening and streamlining the Energy Efficiency Directive so that it contributes to achieving the higher climate target and the European Green Deal objectives. Furthermore, there is a potential for the Energy Efficiency Directive to better tackle socio-economic challenges like protecting and empowering vulnerable customers and final users and alleviating energy poverty. Regarding industries, the evaluation shows that a key barrier is likely to be that most businesses do not have the expertise to know what technical energy saving opportunities are available, or what their economic benefits might be for the business.

      In terms of effectiveness, the Energy Efficiency Directive has led to energy efficiency improvements across the Union thanks to its targets (notably Article 3 and Article 5) and binding measures (notably Article 7 on energy savings obligations), even though the progress in achieving the Union energy efficiency targets for 2020 was not sufficient. Achieving the necessary level of energy efficiency improvements relies largely on Member States’ ambition when setting objectives, and their efforts when developing and implementing energy efficiency measures at national level. Although the Energy Efficiency Directive sets final and primary energy consumption limits for the Union as a whole, and the Governance Regulation provides for further Union measures if the targets are not met, the indicative nature of the target does not support its achievement. Article 7 remains an effective measure responsible for generating energy savings mostly in the buildings sector. Obligations for public sector (Articles 5 and 6) proved key to demonstrate the exemplary role of central governments in promoting energy efficiency via renovations and public procurement. However, the measures were implemented at a limited scale, and a number of limitations prevent reaping energy savings potential in the public sector. The Energy Efficiency Directive was also key to promoting the use of energy audits across the Union (Article 8). However, important limitations remain such as follow up to audits and challenges related to application of the SMEs definition, lack of requirements and incentives for implementing energy management systems. The requirements of Article 14 on heating and cooling, in particular the requirement to establish comprehensive assessments, helped to increase the overall importance and awareness of heating and cooling in all Member States. However, the analysis showed that the overall impact had rather been low, in particular due to the lack of follow up given to the findings from the comprehensive assessments carried out in line with Article 14, and the wide use of exemptions allowed. The Energy Efficiency Directive largely contributed to the development of energy services markets and energy performance contracting (Article 18). However, important barriers still remain to be tackled.

      In terms of efficiency, overall, the Energy Efficiency Directive has contributed to achieving energy savings in the Union in a cost-effective manner. Several provisions subject to `conditionalities´ (e.g. in Articles 5, 6, 9-11, 14) required to act, if it is cost-effective/ economically or technically feasible. It gave significant flexibility to Member States to choose measures. However, Member States have not always demonstrated how the feasibility was established. There are no indications for significant differences in the magnitude of costs amongst the Member States for most of the provisions of the Energy Efficiency Directive, except for Article 7 (the costs depend on the design and scope of the measure).

      In terms of coherence, the Energy Efficiency Directive is overall coherent with broader energy and climate policies, however, the increasing interlinkages with renewable energy and the EU ETS require proper streamlining and closer look at reducing administrative burden. In addition, the Energy Efficiency Directive provisions need to be adapted to support the decarbonisation and zero pollution objectives in the context of the initiatives under the European Green Deal.

      In terms of Union added value, Union intervention was key to achieve energy efficiency improvements across the Union. It is clear that without the EU level target and binding measures it would not have been achieved to the scale observed. However, there is scope for strengthening and streamlining some provisions to ensure that the Energy Efficiency Directive delivers the required efforts in view the higher Union climate target of at least 55% for 2030.

       The main impact of the measure will be that the Union uses less energy without affecting the delivering of desired services. This reduction in energy use will be accompanied by co-benefits such as improved energy security and reduced environmental impacts. The lower environmental impacts are primarily due to around 8% lower emissions of air pollutants, but there are also expected to be environmental benefits from the reduced need for fuel supply, reduced infrastructure needs and lower emissions to water, for example from flue gas clearing equipment. Appropriately targeted public support for building renovations can also bring substantial social benefits thanks to alleviation of energy poverty and commensurate improvements in human health.

      identified possibilities for simplification of the existing legislation and reduction of regulatory costs while aiming at effectiveness of the proposed modifications. Removal of the alternative approach to renovation of public bodies’ buildings will simplify the provisions as it would focus on renovations only. Specific technical aspects in relation to public buildings and certain exemptions are deleted given that they are regulated under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. Removing conditionalities of cost-effectiveness, technical or economic feasibility as regards energy efficiency requirements in public procurement will simplify the implementation of the energy efficiency requirements, as they will apply equally to all public authorities.

      Ensuring that energy audit efforts are focussed on larger energy users will lead to proportionately higher energy savings, which would result in a substantial reduction in burden for businesses with a lower energy use, as well as simplifying the burden on public administrations, since they would have a simpler criterion to assess the need for audits as well as a smaller number of businesses to verify. The increased compliance costs for those businesses remaining under the scope of the provision would be expected to be paid back through increased uptake of cost-effective improvement measures.

      Amendments will strengthen the existing monitoring and reporting requirements notably regarding measures targeting energy poverty under energy savings obligation (Article 8) and building renovations for public sector, which would ensure a more effective outcomes, but will also result in a higher administrative burden for public authorities. Requiring additional monitoring and reporting requirements as regards public procurement and energy performance contracting would further improve the effectiveness of these provisions, but may increase administrative burden to some extent on businesses and public authorities.

      Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action established an integrated energy and climate planning, monitoring and reporting framework, to monitor progress towards the climate and energy targets in line with the transparency requirements of the Paris Agreement. Member States had to submit to the Commission their integrated national energy and climate plans by the end of 2019, covering the five dimensions of the Energy Union for the period 2021-2030. Member States must report biennially on the progress made in implementing the plans and in addition, by 30 June 2023 they must notify the Commission of their draft updates of the plans, with the final updates due on 30 June 2024. This update would cover any new targets agreed in the revision of EED. This reporting system under the Governance Regulation is considered to have been effective in monitoring Member States’ progress towards the Union and national level energy efficiency energy contributions.

       The EED introduces a new article (Article 3) on the Energy Efficiency First principle to ensure that the principle is applied where relevant and properly monitored across the board. The Directive does not specify how this should be done given the wide scope of application of the principle. To facilitate the implementation of the Energy Efficiency Directive provisions, the European Commission will issue a recommendation to Member States including a guidance how the principle should be interpreted and applied in various contexts. This guidance document should help make the principle more operational.

      The main provisions which substantially change Directive 2012/27/EU or add new elements are the following:
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Articles 1 and 4 set an increased Union binding energy efficiency target for final and primary consumption, as well as indicative national energy efficiency contributions and provides a formula to Member States to calculate their contributions. The Union targets are set in terms of the level of final and primary energy consumption to be achieved in 2030 and the level of ambition is expressed by comparing these levels to the 2020 Reference Scenario projections for 2030. The level of ambition expressed in such way reflects additional efforts compared to the efforts that are in place or indicated in the National Energy and Climate Plans. Comparisons to the previous baseline that is the 2007 Reference Scenario projections for 2030 and historical values from 2005 are kept in the recitals.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      National contributions remain indicative given strong opposition by the majority of Member States towards binding national targets expressed in the public consultation and in other fora. However, benchmarks and new delivery gap mechanisms are proposed complementing those that were proposed in the Governance Regulation.

      Article 3 introduces a new provision on the Energy Efficiency First principle, to provide the legal basis for the application of the principle, while minimising the administrative burden. It includes an obligation to consider energy efficiency solutions in policy and investment decisions in energy systems and non-energy sectors, including social housing.

      Article 6

      broadens the scope of the renovation obligation. The obligation will now be applied to all public bodies at all administration levels and in all sectors of public bodies’ activities, including healthcare, education and public housing, where the buildings are owned by public bodies. This will bring the benefits of public buildings renovation closer to all people in all Member States and it will multiply the renovations in the public sector. Article 6 aims at renovations meeting the Near Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) standard, which is an enhanced cost effective standard for renovations. The renovation rate remains at least 3%, which is the lowest common denominator for a minimum renovation rate, while it is recognised that some Member States, regions and cities have already adopted higher renovation requirements and standards in the public sector. Finally, the alternatives that allowed Member States to reach similar energy savings through other measures than renovations are deleted. Such measures can continue counting for the energy savings obligations under Article 8 and contribute to the achievements of the obligation under Article 8. Article 6 aims at renovations in line with the Renovation Wave Strategy.

      Article 7 strengthens the public procurement provisions by extending the obligation to take into account the energy efficiency requirements by all public administration levels, and by removing conditionalities with regard to cost-effectiveness, technical and economic feasibility. The amendments will include a provision that Member States may require that public bodies consider where appropriate circular economy aspects and green public procurement criteria in public procurement practices. Member States will be required to support public bodies by providing guidelines and methodologies on the assessment of lifecycle costs, and by putting in place competence support centres and encouraging using aggregated procurement and digital procurement.

     </span>
     <span>
      the annual energy savings obligation to 1.5% for all Member States (including Cyprus and Malta), and includes specific requirements for the alleviation of energy poverty. It requires to implement policy measures as a priority among vulnerable customers and final users, people affected by energy poverty and, where applicable, people living in social housing, and to make best possible use of public funding and, where applicable, to consider the use of revenues of ETS allowances. Article 8 requires Member States to ensure that national policy mix has no adverse effects on vulnerable customers and final users, people affected by energy poverty and, where applicable, people living in social housing and that those policies effectively alleviate and reduce energy poverty. Article 8 requires Member States to achieve a share of the total amount of required end-use energy savings among vulnerable customers and final users, people affected by energy poverty and, where applicable, people living in social housing. Article 8 establishes a delivery gap mechanism regarding the required amount of energy savings to be achieved in a given obligation period. The energy savings obligation does not foresee the application of the flexibilities to calculate the required amount of energy savings alternatively as of 1 January 2024 (Article 8(6) to (9)). Article 9 includes transmission system operators as potential obligated parties, and allows Member States to require obligated parties to achieve an amount of energy savings among vulnerable customers and final users, people affected by energy poverty and, where applicable, people living in social housing. Annex V excludes the accountability of energy saving from policy measures regarding the use of direct fossil fuel combustion technologies, and clarifies that a reduction of the energy use through measures under the ETS Directive cannot count towards the fulfilment of the energy savings obligation, and strengthens the additionality requirement regarding taxation measures.

      Article 11 shifts the criterion for energy audits and energy management systems from the type of enterprises to the levels of energy consumption and requires a sign off of the audit recommendations by the management of the company. It also requires energy management systems for the largest energy using companies, which are likely to be more effective at ensuring that more cost saving energy saving investments will be made while probably having a lower overall cost burden on the company. Finally, the Article introduces an obligation for the monitoring of the energy performance of data centres with the aim of later establishing a set of “data centre sustainability indicators”.

      The Union is facing unprecedented challenges resulting from increased dependence on energy imports and scarce energy resources, and the need to limit climate change and to overcome the economic crisis. Energy efficiency is a valuable means to address these challenges. It improves the Union’s security of supply by reducing primary energy consumption and decreasing energy imports. It helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective way and thereby to mitigate climate change. Shifting to a more energy-efficient economy should also accelerate the spread of innovative technological solutions and improve the competitiveness of industry in the Union, boosting economic growth and creating high quality jobs in several sectors related to energy efficiency.

      The Conclusions of the European Council of 8 and 9 March 2007 emphasised the need to increase energy efficiency in the Union to achieve the objective of saving 20 % of the Union’s primary energy consumption by 2020 compared to projections. The conclusions of the European Council of 4 February 2011 emphasised that the 2020 20 % energy efficiency target as agreed by the June 2010 European Council, which is presently not on track, must be delivered. Projections made in 2007 showed a primary energy consumption in 2020 of 1842 Mtoe. A 20 % reduction results in 1474 Mtoe in 2020, i.e. a reduction of 368 Mtoe as compared to projections.

      The sum of national contributions communicated by Member States in their National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) falls short of the Union’s level of ambition of 32,5%. The contributions collectively would lead to a reduction of 29,4% for final energy consumption and 29,7% for primary energy consumption compared to the projections from the 2007 reference scenario for 2030.

      The energy efficiency first principle should be applied taking primarily the system efficiency approach and societal perspective into consideration. Consequently, it should help increase the efficiency of individual end-use sectors and of the whole energy system. Application of the principle should also support investments in energy-efficient solutions contributing to environmental objectives listed in Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council

      . While the principle is based on cost-effectiveness, its application has wider implications, which can vary depending on the circumstances. The Commission prepared dedicated guidelines for the operation and application of the principle, by proposing specific tools and examples of application in various sectors. The Commission has also issued a recommendation to Member States that builds on the requirements of this Directive and calls for specific actions in relation to the application of the principle.

      In order to have an impact, the energy efficiency first principle needs to be consistently applied by decision makers in all relevant policy, planning and major investment decisions – that is to say large-scale investments with a value of more than 50 euro million each or 75 euro million for transport infrastructure projects – affecting energy consumption or supply. The proper application of the principle requires using the right cost-benefit analysis methodology, setting enabling conditions for energy efficient solutions and proper monitoring. Demand side flexibility can bring significant benefits to consumers and to society at large, and can increase the efficiency of the energy system and decrease the energy costs, for example by reducing system operation costs resulting in lower tariffs for all consumers. Member States should take into account potential benefits from demand side flexibility in applying the energy efficiency first principle and where relevant consider demand response, energy storage and smart solutions as part of their efforts to increase efficiency of the integrated energy system.

      It is projected that the 32,5% Union´s energy efficiency target for 2030 and the other policy instruments of the existing framework would lead to a reduction in GHG emission of about 45% by 2030.

      For an increased climate ambition of a 55% decrease of GHG emissions by 2030, the impact assessment of the 2030 Climate Target Plan assessed what level of efforts would be needed in the different policy areas. It concluded that, in relation to the baseline, achieving the GHG emissions target in a cost-optimal way meant that final and primary energy consumption are to decreased by at least 36-37% and to 39-41% respectively.

      The Union’s energy efficiency target was initially set and calculated using the 2007 Reference Scenario projections for 2030 as a baseline. The change in the Eurostat energy balance calculation methodology and improvements in subsequent modelling projections call for a change of the baseline. Thus, using the same approach to define the target, that is to say comparing it to the future baseline projections, the ambition of the Union’s 2030 energy efficiency target is set compared to the 2020 Reference Scenario projections for 2030 reflecting national contributions from the NECPs. With that updated baseline, the Union will need to further increase its energy efficiency ambition by at least 9% in 2030 compared to the level of efforts under the 2020 Reference Scenario. The new way of expressing the level of ambition for the Union’s targets does not affect the actual level of efforts needed and corresponds to a reduction of 36% for final and 39% for primary energy consumption respectively when compared to the 2007 Reference Scenario projections for 2030.

      The methodology for calculation of final and primary energy consumption is aligned with the new Eurostat methodology, but the indicators used for the purpose of this Directive have different scope - that is they exclude ambient heat and include energy consumption in international aviation for the target in final energy. The use of new indicators also implies that any changes in energy consumption of blast furnaces are now only reflected in primary energy consumption.

A 32,5 % reduction results in 1273 Mtoe and 956 Mtoe in 2030 respectively. That target, which is of the same nature as the Union's 2020 target, should be assessed by the Commission for the purpose of revising it upwards by 2023 in the case of substantial cost reductions or, where needed, to meet the Union's international commitments for decarbonisation.

An additional reduction of 9% results in 787 Mtoe and 1023 Mtoe in 2030 respectively.

      The Commission should therefore closely monitor the implementation of national energy efficiency programmes through its revised legislative framework and within the Europe 2020 process. When setting the indicative national energy efficiency targets, Member States should be able to take into account national circumstances affecting primary energy consumption such as remaining cost-effective energy-saving potential, changes in energy imports and exports, development of all sources of renewable energies, nuclear energy, carbon capture and storage, and early action. When undertaking modelling exercises, the Commission should consult Member States on model assumptions and draft model results in a timely and transparent manner. Improved modelling of the impact of energy efficiency measures and of the stock and performance of technologies is needed.

      states that Cyprus and Malta, due to their insular and peripheral character, rely on aviation as a mode of transport, which is essential for their citizens and their economy. As a result, Cyprus and Malta have a gross final consumption of energy in national air transport which is disproportionately high, i.e. more than three times the Community average in 2005, and are thus disproportionately affected by the current technological and regulatory constraints.

      The

      For that reason the public sector constitutes an important driver to stimulate market transformation towards more efficient products, buildings and services, as well as to trigger behavioural changes in energy consumption by citizens and enterprises. Furthermore, decreasing energy consumption through energy efficiency improvement measures can free up public resources for other purposes. Public bodies at national, regional and local level should fulfil an exemplary role as regards energy efficiency.

      Bearing in mind that the Council conclusions of 10 June 2011 on the Energy Efficiency Plan 2011 stressed that buildings represent 40 % of the Union’s final energy consumption, and in order to capture the growth and employment opportunities in the skilled trades and construction sectors, as well as in the production of construction products and in professional activities such as architecture, consultancy and engineering, Member States should establish a long-term strategy beyond 2020 for mobilising investment in the renovation of residential and commercial buildings with a view to improving the energy performance of the building stock. That strategy should address cost-effective deep renovations which lead to a refurbishment that reduces both the delivered and the final energy consumption of a building by a significant percentage compared with the pre-renovation levels leading to a very high energy performance. Such deep renovations could also be carried out in stages.

      public sector
     </span>
     <span>
      should set its own decarbonisation and energy efficiency goals. Energy efficiency improvements in the public sector should reflect the efforts required at Union level. To comply with the final energy consumption target, the Union should decrease its final energy consumption by 19% by 2030 as compared to the average energy consumption in years 2017, 2018 and 2019. An obligation to achieve an annual reduction of the energy consumption in the public sector by at least 1,7% should ensure that the public sector fulfils its exemplary role. Member States retain full flexibility regarding the choice of energy efficiency improvement measures to achieve a reduction of the final energy consumption. Requiring an annual reduction of final energy consumption has a lower administrative burden than establishing measurement methods for energy savings.

      Public authorities are encouraged to obtain support from entities such as sustainable energy agencies, where applicable established at regional or local level. The organisation of those agencies usually reflect the individual needs of public authorities in a certain region or operating in a certain area of the public sector. Centralised agencies can serve the needs better and work more effectively in other respects, for example, in smaller or centralised Member States or regarding complex or cross-regional aspects such as district heating and cooling. Sustainable energy agencies can serve as one-stop-shops pursuant to Article 21. Those agencies are often
     </span>
     <span>
     </span>
     <span>
      responsible for developing local or regional decarbonisation plans, which may also include other decarbonisation measures, such as the exchange of fossil fuels boilers, and to support public authorities in the implementation of energy related policies. Sustainable energy agencies or other entities to assist regional and local authorities mayhave clear competences, objectives and resources in the field of sustainable energy. Sustainable energy agencies could be encouraged to consider initiatives taken in the framework of the Covenant of Mayors, which brings together local governments voluntarily committed to implementing the Union´s climate and energy objectives, and other existing initiatives for this purpose. The decarbonisation plans should be linked to territorial development plans and take into account the comprehensive assessment which the Member States should carry out.

For that purpose, Member States could set up national competence centres on complex issues, such as advising local or regional energy agencies on district heating or cooling.

      It is also important that Member States monitor how the energy efficiency requirements are taken into account by contracting authorities and contracting entities in the procurement of products, buildings, works and services by ensuring that information about the impact on energy efficiency of those wining tenders above the thresholds referred to in the procurement directives are made publically available. That allows stakeholders and citizens to assess the role of public sector towards ensuring energy efficiency first in public procurement in a transparent manner.

      The European Green Deal recognises the role of circular economy in contributing to overall Union decarbonisation objectives. The public sector can contribute to those objectives by using their purchasing power to, where appropriate, choose environmentally friendly products, buildings, services and works via available tools for green public procurement, and thus making an important contribution to reduce energy consumption and environmental impacts.

      It is important that Member States provide the necessary support to public bodies in the uptake of energy efficiency requirements in public procurement and, where appropriate, use of green public procurement, by providing necessary guidelines and methodologies on carrying out the assessment of life-cycle costs, and environment impacts and costs. Well-designed tools, in particular digital tools, are expected to facilitate the procurement procedures and reduce the administrative costs especially in smaller Member States that may not have sufficient capacity to prepare tenders. In this regard, Member States should actively promote the use of digital tools and cooperation amongst contracting authorities including across borders for the purpose of exchanging best practice.

      Given that buildings are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions before and after their operational lifetime, Member States should also consider the whole life-cycle of carbon emissions of buildings. That takes place in the context of efforts to increase attention to whole life cycle performance, circular economy aspects and environmental impacts, as part of the exemplary role of the public sector. Public procurement can thus serve as an opportunity to address the embodied carbon in buildings over their life-cycle. In this regard, contracting authorities are important actors that can take action as part of procurement procedures by purchasing new buildings that address global warming potential over the full life-cycle.

      The global warming potential over the full life-cycle measures the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the building at different stages along its life cycle. It therefore measures the building’s overall contribution to emissions that lead to climate change. That is sometimes referred to as a carbon footprint assessment or the whole life carbon measurement. It brings together carbon emissions embodied in building materials with direct and indirect carbon emissions from use stage. Buildings are a significant material bank, being repositories for carbon intensive resources over many decades, and so it is important to explore designs that facilitate future reuse and recycling at the end of the operational life.

      The global warming potential is expressed as a numeric indicator in kgCO2e/m² (of useful internal floor area) for each life-cycle stage averaged for one year of a reference study period of 50 years. The data selection, scenario definition and calculations are carried out in accordance with standard EN 15978. The scope of building elements and technical equipment are set out in indicator 1,2 of the Level(s) common Union framework. Where a national calculation tool exists, or is required for making disclosures or for obtaining building permits, it should be possible to use that national tool to provide the required information. It should be possible to use other calculation tools, if they fulfil the minimum criteria laid down by the Level(s) common Union framework.

      An assessment of the possibility of establishing a ‘white certificate’ scheme at Union level has shown that, in the current situation, such a system would create excessive administrative costs and that there is a risk that energy savings would be concentrated in a number of Member States and not introduced across the Union. The objective of such a Union-level scheme could be better achieved, at least at this stage, by means of national energy efficiency obligation schemes for energy utilities or other alternative policy measures that achieve the same amount of energy savings. It is appropriate for the level of ambition of such schemes to be established in a common framework at Union level while providing significant flexibility to Member States to take fully into account the national organisation of market actors, the specific context of the energy sector and final customers’ habits. The common framework should give energy utilities the option of offering energy services to all final customers, not only to those to whom they sell energy. This increases competition in the energy market because energy utilities can differentiate their product by providing complementary energy services. The common framework should allow Member States to include requirements in their national scheme that pursue a social aim, in particular in order to ensure that vulnerable customers have access to the benefits of higher energy efficiency. Member States should determine, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria, which energy distributors or retail energy sales companies should be obliged to achieve the end-use energy savings target laid down in this Directive.

      Member States should in particular be allowed not to impose this obligation on small energy distributors, small retail energy sales companies and small energy sectors to avoid disproportionate administrative burdens. The Commission Communication of 25 June 2008 sets out principles that should be taken into account by Member States that decide to abstain from applying this possibility. As a means of supporting national energy efficiency initiatives, obligated parties under national energy efficiency obligation schemes could fulfil their obligations by contributing annually to an Energy Efficiency National Fund an amount that is equal to the investments required under the scheme.

      To empower and protect vulnerable customers, people affected by energy poverty and people living in social housing, and to implement policy measures as a priority among those people, Member States can require obligated parties to achieve energy savings among vulnerable customers, people affected by energy poverty and people living in social housing. For that purpose, Member States can also establish energy cost reduction targets. Obligated parties could achieve these targets by promoting the installation of measures that lead to energy savings and financial savings on energy bills, such as the installation of insulation and heating measures.

      Member States should not promote activities that are not environmentally sustainable such as use of solid fossil fuels. The energy savings obligation aims at strengthening the response to climate change by promoting incentives to Member States to implement a sustainable and clean policy mix, which is resilient, and mitigates climate change. Therefore, energy savings from policy measures regarding the use of direct fossil fuel combustion will not be eligible energy savings under energy savings obligation as of transposition of this Directive. It will allow aligning the energy savings obligation with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the Climate Target Plan, the Renovation Wave Strategy, and mirror the need for action identified by the IEA in its net zero report

      . The restriction aims at encouraging Member States to spend public money into future-proof, sustainable technologies only. It is important that Member States provide a clear policy framework and investment certainty to market actors. The implementation of the calculation methodology under energy savings obligation should allow all market actors to adapt their technologies in a reasonable timeframe. Where Member States support the uptake of efficient fossil fuel technologies or early replacement of such technology, for example through subsidy schemes or energy efficiency obligation schemes, energy savings may not be eligible anymore under the energy savings obligation. While energy savings resulting, for example, from the promotion of natural gas-based cogeneration would not be eligible, the restriction would not apply for indirect fossil fuel usage, for example where the electricity production includes fossil fuel generation. Policy measures targeting behavioural changes to reduce the consumption of fossil fuel, for example through information campaigns, eco-driving, should remain eligible. The energy savings from policy measures targeting building renovations may contain measures such as a replacement of fossil fuel heating systems together with building fabric improvements, which should be limited to those technologies that allow achieving the required energy savings according to the national building codes established in a Member State. Nevertheless, Member States should promote upgrading heating systems as part of deep renovations in line with the long-term objective of carbon neutrality, i.e. reducing the heating demand and covering the remaining heating demand with a carbon-free energy source.

      Studies carried out and consultation of stakeholders have revealed a significant potential. However, the physical and economic conditions are quite different among Member States, and often within several Member States, and there is a large number system operators. Those circumstances point to a decentralized approach, pursuant to the subsidiarity principle. National Regulatory Authorities have the required knowledge, legal competences and the administrative capacity to promote the development of an energy efficient electricity grid. Entities such as the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the

      Similar considerations apply for the very large number of natural gas system operators. The role of natural gas and the rate of supply and coverage of the territory is highly variable among Member States. In those cases National Regulatory Authorities are best placed to monitor and steer the system evolution towards an increased efficiency, and entities such as European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG) can provide useful contributions and should support their members in the uptake of energy efficiency measures.

At the same time, water leaks account for 24% of total water consumed in the Union and the energy sector is the largest consumer of water, accounting for 44% of consumption.

      This Directive refers to the concept of vulnerable customers, which Member States are to establish pursuant to Directive (EU) 2019/944. In addition, pursuant to Directive 2012/27/EU, the notion of ‘final users’ alongside the notion of ‘final customer’ clarifies that the rights to billing and consumption information also apply to consumers without individual or direct contracts with the supplier of energy used for collective heating, cooling or domestic hot water production systems in multi-occupant buildings. The concept of vulnerable customers does not necessarily ensure the targeting of final users. Therefore, in order to ensure that the measures set out in this Directive reach all individuals and households in a situation of vulnerability, Member States should include not only customers, in its strict sense, but also final users, in establishing their definition of vulnerable customers.

      The Union's building stock needs, in the long term, to be converted to NZEBs in accordance with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Current building renovation rates are insufficient and buildings occupied by citizens on low incomes who are affected by energy poverty are the hardest to reach. The measures laid down in this Directive with regard to energy savings obligations, energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures are therefore of particular importance.

      To tap the energy savings potential in certain market segments where energy audits are generally not offered commercially (such as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)), Member States should develop programmes to encourage SMEs to undergo energy audits. Energy audits should be mandatory and regular for large enterprises, as energy savings can be significant. Energy audits should take into account relevant European or International Standards, such as EN ISO 50001 (Energy Management Systems), or EN 16247-1 (Energy Audits), or, if including an energy audit, EN ISO 14000 (Environmental Management Systems) and thus be also in line with the provisions of Annex VI to this Directive as such provisions do not go beyond the requirements of these relevant standards.

      A specific European standard on energy audits is currently under development. Energy audits may be carried out on a stand-alone basis or be part of a broader environmental management system or an energy performance contract. In all such cases those systems should comply with the minimum requirements of Annex VI. In addition, specific mechanisms and schemes established to monitor emissions and fuel consumption by certain transport operators, for example under EU law the EU ETS, may be considered compatible with energy audits, including in energy management systems, if they comply with the minimum requirements set out in Annex VI.

      The enterprise’s average consumption should be the criterion to define the application of energy management systems and of energy audits in order to increase the sensitivity of those mechanisms in identifying relevant opportunities for cost-effective energy savings. Enterprises that are below the consumption thresholds defined for energy management systems and energy audits should be encouraged to undergo energy audits and to implement the recommendations resulting from those audits.

      The information and communications technology (ICT) sector another important sector which receives increasing attention. In 2018 the energy consumption of data centres in the EU was 76,8 TWh. This is expected to rise to 98.5 TWh by 2030, a 28% increase. This increase in absolute terms can as well be seen in relative terms: within the EU, data centres accounted for 2,7% of electricity demand in 2018 and will reach 3,21% by 2030 if development continues on the current trajectory

      . Europe’s Digital Strategy already highlighted the need for highly energy-efficient and sustainable data centres and calls for transparency measures for telecommunication operators on their environmental footprint. To promote sustainable development in the ICT sector, particularly of data centres, Member States should collect and publish data, which is relevant for the energy performance and water footprint of data centres. Member States should collect and publish data only about data centres with a significant footprint, for which appropriate design or efficiency interventions, for new or existing installations respectively, can result in a considerable reduction of the energy and water consumption or in the reuse of waste heat in nearby facilities and heat networks. A data centre sustainability indicator can be established on the basis of that data collected

      The data centre sustainability indicators can be used to measure four basic dimensions of a sustainable data centre, namely how efficiently it uses energy, how much of that energy comes from renewable energy sources, the reuse of any waste heat that it produces and the usage of freshwater. The data centre sustainability indicators should raise awareness amongst data centre owners and operators, manufactures of equipment, developers of software and services, users of data centre services at all levels as well as entities and organisations that deploy, use or procure cloud and data centre services. It should also give confidence about the actual improvements following efforts and measures to increase the sustainability in new or existing data centres. Finally, it should be used as a basis for transparent and evidence-based planning and decision-making. Use of the data centre sustainability indicators should be optional for Member States.

      The definition of the term ‘final customer’ is capable of being understood as referring only to natural or legal persons purchasing energy based on a direct, individual contract with an energy supplier. For the purposes of the relevant provisions, the term ‘final user’ should therefore be introduced to refer to a broader group of consumers and should, in addition to final customers purchasing heating, cooling or domestic hot water for their own end-use, also cover occupants of individual buildings or of individual units of multi-apartment or multi-purpose buildings where such units are supplied from a central source and where the occupants have no direct or individual contract with the energy supplier. The term ‘sub-metering’ should refer to measuring consumption in individual units of such buildings.

      In order to achieve the transparency of accounting for individual consumption of thermal energy and thereby facilitate the implementation of sub-metering, Member States should ensure they have in place transparent, publicly available national rules on the allocation of the cost of heating, cooling and domestic hot water consumption in multi-apartment and multi-purpose buildings. In addition to transparency, Member States could consider taking measures to strengthen competition in the provision of sub-metering services and thereby help ensure that any costs borne by the final users are reasonable.

      Billing information and annual statements are an important means by which customers are informed of their energy consumption. Data on consumption and costs can also convey other information that helps consumers to compare their current deal with other offers and to make use of complaint management and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. However, considering that bill-related disputes are a common source of consumer complaints and a factor which contributes to persistently low levels of consumer satisfaction and engagement with their energy providers, it is necessary to make bills simpler, clearer and easier to understand, while ensuring that separate instruments, such as billing information, information tools and annual statements, provide all the necessary information to enable consumers to regulate their energy consumption, compare offers and switch suppliers.

      Use of individual meters or heat cost allocators for measuring individual consumption of heating in multi-apartment buildings supplied by district heating or common central heating is beneficial when final customers have a means to control their own individual consumption.

      In some multi-apartment buildings supplied by district heating or common central heating, the use of accurate individual heat meters would be technically complicated and costly due to the fact that the hot water used for heating enters and leaves the apartments at several points. It can be assumed that individual metering of heat consumption in multi-apartment buildings is, nevertheless, technically possible when the installation of individual meters would not require changing the existing in-house piping for hot water heating in the building. In such buildings, measurements of individual heat consumption can then be carried out by means of individual heat cost allocators installed on each radiator.

      Directive 2006/32/EC requires Member States to ensure that final customers are provided with competitively priced individual meters that accurately reflect their actual energy consumption and provide information on actual time of use. In most cases, this requirement is subject to the conditions that it should be technically possible, financially reasonable, and proportionate in relation to the potential energy savings. When a connection is made in a new building or a building undergoes major renovations, as defined in Directive 2010/31/EU, such individual meters should, however, always be provided. Directive 2006/32/EC also requires that clear billing based on actual consumption should be provided frequently enough to enable consumers to regulate their own energy use.

      The impact of the provisions on metering and billing in Directives 2006/32/EC, 2009/72/EC and 2009/73/EC on energy saving has been limited. In many parts of the Union, these provisions have not led to customers receiving up-to-date information about their energy consumption, or billing based on actual consumption at a frequency which studies show is needed to enable customers to regulate their energy use. In the sectors of space heating and hot water in multi-apartment buildings the insufficient clarity of these provisions has also led to numerous complaints from citizens.

      In order to strengthen the empowerment of final customers as regards access to information from the metering and billing of their individual energy consumption, bearing in mind the opportunities associated with the process of the implementation of intelligent metering systems and the roll out of smart meters in the Member States, it is important that the requirements of Union law in this area be made clearer. This should help reduce the costs of the implementation of intelligent metering systems equipped with functions enhancing energy saving and support the development of markets for energy services and demand management. Implementation of intelligent metering systems enables frequent billing based on actual consumption. However, there is also a need to clarify the requirements for access to information and fair and accurate billing based on actual consumption in cases where smart meters will not be available by 2020, including in relation to metering and billing of individual consumption of heating, cooling and hot water in multi-unit buildings supplied by district heating/cooling or own common heating system installed in such buildings.

      Requirements for efficient district heating and cooling should be consistent with long-term climate policy goals, the climate and environmental standards and priorities of the Union, and should comply with the principle of ‘do no significant harm’ within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2020/85. All the district heating and cooling systems should aim for improved ability to interact with other parts of the energy system in order to optimise the use of energy and prevent energy waste by using the full potential of buildings to store heat or cold, including the excess heat from service facilities and nearby data centres. For that reason, efficient district heating and cooling system should ensure the increase of primary energy efficiency and a progressive integration of renewable energy and waste heat or cold. Therefore, this Directive stricter requirements for heating and cooling supply should be introduced progressively and should be applicable during specific established time periods and should be permanently applicable from 1 January 2050 onwards.

To maximise energy savings and avoid energy saving opportunities being missed, the greatest attention should be paid to the operating conditions of cogeneration units.

      to choose between electricity from cogeneration and electricity produced by other techniques, the origin of high-efficiency cogeneration should be guaranteed on the basis of harmonised efficiency reference values. Guarantee of origin schemes do not by themselves imply a right to benefit from national support mechanisms. It is important that all forms of electricity produced from high-efficiency cogeneration can be covered by guarantees of origin. Guarantees of origin should be distinguished from exchangeable certificates.

      Demand response can be based on final customers’ responses to price signals or on building automation. Conditions for, and access to, demand response should be improved, including for small final consumers. Taking into account the continuing deployment of smart grids, Member States should therefore ensure that national energy regulatory authorities are able to ensure that network tariffs and regulations incentivise improvements in energy efficiency and support dynamic pricing for demand response measures by final customers. Market integration and equal market entry opportunities for demand-side resources (supply and consumer loads) alongside generation should be pursued. In addition,

      Without prejudice to security of supply, market integration and anticipatory investments in offshore grids necessary for the deployment of offshore renewable energy, national energy regulatory authorities should ensure that the energy efficiency first principle is applied in the planning and decision making processes and that network tariffs and regulations incentivise improvements in energy efficiency. Member States should also ensure that transmission and distribution system operators consider the energy efficiency first principle. That would help transmission and distribution system operators to consider better energy efficiency solutions and incremental costs incurred for the procurement of demand side resources, as well as the environmental and socio-economic impacts of different network investments and operation plans. Such an approach requires a shift from the narrow economic efficiency perspective to maximised social welfare. The energy efficiency first principle should in particular be applied in the context of scenario building for energy infrastructure expansion where demand side solutions could be considered as viable alternatives and need to be properly assessed, and it should become an intrinsic part of the assessment of network planning projects. Its application should be scrutinised by national regulatory authorities.

      That can help attracting private capital which is key for increasing building renovation rates in the Union, bring expertise into the market and create innovative business models. Therefore, non-residential buildings with the useful floor area above 1000 m2 should be required to assess the feasibility of using energy performance contracting for renovation. That is a step ahead to increase the trust in energy services companies and pave the way for increasing such projects in the future.

      Given the ambitious renovation objectives over the next decade in the context of the Commission’s Communication entitled Renovation Wave it is necessary to increase the role of independent market intermediaries including one stop shops or similar support mechanisms in order to stimulate market development on the demand and supply sides and to promote energy performance contracting for renovation of both private and public buildings. Local energy agencies could play a key role in this regard, and identify and support setting up potential facilitators or one-stop-shops.

      Energy performance contracting still faces important barriers in several Member States due to remaining regulatory and non-regulatory barriers. It is therefore necessary to address the ambiguities of the national legislative frameworks, lack of expertise, especially as regards to tendering procedures, and competing loans and grants.

      Member States used the 2014 and 2017 National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAPs) to report progress in removing regulatory and non-regulatory barriers to energy efficiency, as regards the split of incentives between the owners and tenants or among owners of a building or building units. However, Member States should continue working in that direction and tap the potential for energy efficiency in the context of the 2016 Eurostat statistics, represented by the fact that more than four out of ten Europeans live in flats and more than three out of ten Europeans are tenants.

      Directive 2006/32/EC requires Member States to adopt, and aim to achieve, an overall national indicative energy savings target of 9 % by 2016, to be reached by deploying energy services and other energy efficiency improvement measures. That Directive states that the second Energy Efficiency Plan adopted by the Member States shall be followed, as appropriate and where necessary, by Commission proposals for additional measures, including extending the period of application of targets. If a report concludes that insufficient progress has been made towards achieving the indicative national targets laid down by that Directive, these proposals are to address the level and nature of the targets. The impact assessment accompanying this Directive finds that the Member States are on track to achieve the 9 % target, which is substantially less ambitious than the subsequently adopted 20 % energy saving target for 2020, and therefore there is no need to address the level of the targets.

Many of those barriers are still relevant.

      Cross–sectorial law provides a strong basis for consumer protection for a wide range of current energy services, and is likely to evolve. Nevertheless, certain basic contractual rights of customers should be clearly established.

      Greater consumer protection is guaranteed by the availability of effective, independent out-of-court dispute settlement mechanisms for all consumers, such as an energy ombudsman, a consumer body or a regulatory authority. Member States should therefore introduce speedy and effective complaint-handling procedures.

      . Calculations reflecting the energy mix of the PEF for electricity are based on annual average values. The ‘physical energy content’ accounting method is used for nuclear electricity and heat generation and the ‘technical conversion efficiency’ method is used for electricity and heat generation from fossil fuels and biomass. For non-combustible renewable energy, the method is the direct equivalent based on the ‘total primary energy’ approach. To calculate the primary energy share for electricity in cogeneration, the method set out in Annex II to

Conversion efficiencies are assumed to be 100 % for non-combustible renewables, 10 % for geothermal power stations and 33 % for nuclear power stations. The calculation of total efficiency for cogeneration is based on the most recent data from Eurostat. As for system boundaries, the PEF is 1 for all energy sources. The PEF value refers to 2018 and is based on data interpolated from the most recent version of the PRIMES Reference Scenario for 2015 and 2020 and adjusted with Eurostat data until 2016. The analysis covers the Member States and Norway. The dataset for Norway is based on the

      Energy savings which result from the implementation of Union law should not be claimed unless they result from a measure that goes beyond the minimum required by the Union legal act in question, whether by setting more ambitious energy efficiency requirements at Member State level or by increasing the take-up of the measure. Buildings present a substantial potential for further increasing energy efficiency, and the renovation of buildings is an essential and long-term element with economies of scale in increasing energy savings. It is therefore necessary to clarify that it is possible to claim all energy savings stemming from measures promoting the renovation of existing buildings, provided that they exceed the savings that would have occurred in the absence of the policy measure and provided that the Member State demonstrates that the obligated, participating or entrusted party has in fact contributed to the achievement of the energy savings claimed.

      Some of the changes introduced by this Directive might require a subsequent amendment to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 in order to ensure coherence between the two legal acts. New provisions, mainly related to setting national contributions, gap filling mechanisms and reporting obligations, should be streamlined and transferred to that Regulation, once it is amended. Some provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 might also need to be reassessed in view of the changes proposed in this Directive. The additional reporting and monitoring requirements should not create any new parallel reporting systems but would be subject to the existing monitoring and reporting framework under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.

       See IRP, Resource Efficiency and Climate Change, 2020, and UN Environment Emissions Gap Report, 2019. These figures refer to the use and operation of buildings, including indirect emissions in the power and heat sector, not their full life cycle. The embodied carbon in construction is estimated to account for about 10% of total yearly greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, see IRP, Resource Efficiency and Climate Change, 2020, and UN Environment Emissions Gap Report 2019.

       The Union’s energy efficiency target was initially set and calculated using the 2007 Reference Scenario projections for 2030 as a baseline. The change in the Eurostat energy balance calculation methodology and improvements in subsequent modelling projections call for a change of the baseline. Thus, using the same approach to define the target, that is to say comparing it to the future baseline projections, the ambition of the Union’s 2030 energy efficiency target is set compared to the 2020 Reference Scenario projections for 2030 reflecting national contributions from the NECPs. With that updated baseline, the Union will need to further increase its energy efficiency ambition by at least 9 % in 2030 compared to the level of efforts under the 2020 Reference Scenario. The new way of expressing the level of ambition for the Union’s targets does not affect the actual level of efforts needed.

       The analysis of the economic potential should present the volume of energy (in GWh) that can be generated per year by each technology analysed. The limitations and interrelations within the energy system should also be taken into account. The analysis may make use of models based on assumptions representing the operation of common types of technologies or systems.
