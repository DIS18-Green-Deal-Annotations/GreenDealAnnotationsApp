      Considering current and projected emissions from the aviation sector, and in the context of an enhanced climate ambition of the EU for 2030, the climate contribution needs to be significantly strengthened, also with a view to allow for the necessary contribution to the EU climate neutrality by 2050.  The 2019 European Aviation Environment Report has also highlighted this need.

      The Commission has prepared a number of impact assessments to support the envisaged revisions of key legislative instruments for the “Fit for 55” policy package. The impact assessment on the revision of EU ETS aviation rules analyses various options through which the revision could effectively and efficiently contribute to the delivery of the updated target as part of the wider package. Therefore, the revision of aviation rules must be addressed together with the revision of EU ETS for stationary installations and its extension to other sectors. ETS elements where the interlinkage of revisions is particularly prominent are the provisions concerning total quantity of aviation allowances and application of linear reduction factor thereto as well as provisions regarding market stability reserve. Choices regarding the scope of EU ETS and CORSIA implementation will impact the level of emission reductions of the ETS sector, and demand for EU allowances. Choices regarding the auctioning share of aviation allowances will impact the amount of auctioning revenues available for tackling climate change, as well as distributional elements.

    <p class="Normal">
     <span class="normaltextrun">
      For aviation to contribute to the goals of the Paris Agreement, broader global action should also take place. EU has supported ICAO’s CORSIA, and is working with others to encourage adequate participation and implementation. The review of the EU ETS for aviation should ensure that CORSIA is implemented as appropriate through the EU ETS and implementation of CORSIA needs to ensure equal treatment of airlines. At the same time, any amendment of the EU ETS Directive must be consistent with EU’s ambition to become climate neutral by 2050, the Union’s economy-wide greenhouse gas emission reduction commitment for 2030 and with the aim of preserving the environmental integrity and effectiveness of Union climate action.

As free allocation is a derogation from the ‘polluter pays’ principle, the default method in EU ETS is auctioning. The underlying analysis also suggests a low risk of carbon leakage and a very limited impact on consumer prices when increasing auctioning in respect of aviation.

       As indicated in the European Green Deal, reducing climate change impacts from aviation requires a mix of policy instruments, as there is no one single solution to decarbonise the sector. The revision of the EU ETS for aviation is therefore part of a so-called “basket of measures”, which includes market-based measures like the EU ETS and CORSIA, the boosting of the production and uptake of sustainable aviation fuels (“SAF”), aircraft technology improvements and operational improvements through e.g. the Single European Sky initiative.

    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span class="normaltextrun">
      The options for implementing CORSIA differ in the extent to which the existing EU ETS coverage is maintained, reduced or extended. Comparison of options shows that while ETS price incentives are orders of magnitude more meaningful than the price of CORSIA quality offsets, the overall environmental impact at global level across policy options is limited due to the limited geographical scope of the EU ETS. However, there are significant differences between the options as regards the contribution to the EU’s emission reduction target. There are also considerable differences in terms of revenues stemming from the different policy option combinations, as CORSIA, by design, does not generate any public revenue from airlines.
     </span>
     <span class="eop">
     </span>
     <span class="normaltextrun">
      The preferred option is to maintain the current EU ETS coverage (intra-EEA flights, including departing flights to Switzerland and to the UK) and introduce appropriate CORSIA-related provisions for flights that are currently not covered by the EU ETS (flights to/from third countries, and by EU-based airlines between two third countries).

       The options for increasing the auction share in allocating aviation allowances differ in the speed of increase. The comparison of the analysed options shows a strong case for moving to full auctioning from the date of entry into force of the revised legislation. While free allowances have been allocated notably to address potential adverse competitiveness impacts and carbon leakage, they constitute a derogation from the ‘polluter pays’ principle. The analysis suggests a low risk of carbon leakage when increasing the auctioning share. Switching to full auctioning implies stabilising the cap for aviation at current levels as auctioning is currently a fixed percentage of free allocations. This would maintain current level of environmental integrity for the aviation cap, and the cap would be subject to the linear reduction factor, as already required by the co-legislators and as is the case for all other operators in the EU ETS. The removal of free allocation in the EU ETS would reinforce its environmental integrity. The preferred option is increased auctioning from the entry into force of the amendment.
