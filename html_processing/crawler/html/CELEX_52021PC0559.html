      Mobility and transport are essential for everyone living in Europe and for the European economy as a whole. Free movement of people and goods across the internal borders of the European Union is a fundamental freedom of the EU and its single market. Mobility brings many socio‑economic benefits to the European public and businesses, but also has a growing impact on the environment, including in the form of increased greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution, which affect human health and well-being.

      . The European Green Deal calls for a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in transport. The aim is for the EU to become a climate-neutral economy by 2050, while also working towards a zero-pollution ambition. In September 2020, the Commission adopted its proposal for a European Climate Law to reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 and to put Europe on a responsible path to becoming climate-neutral by 2050

      ). The strategy lays the foundation for how the EU transport system can achieve this transformation and sets concrete milestones to keep the transport system’s journey towards a smart and sustainable future on track. The transport sector is still vastly reliant on fossil fuels. Boosting the uptake of zero- and low-emission vehicles, vessels and aeroplanes and of renewable and low-carbon fuels in all modes of transport is a priority objective in the quest to make all transport modes more
     </span>

     <span>
      sustainable.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="BodyText">
     <span>
      The increased deployment and use of renewable and low-carbon fuels must go hand in hand with the creation of a comprehensive network of recharging and refuelling infrastructure based on a geographically fair manner to enable the widespread uptake of low- and zero-emission vehicles in all transport modes. In the passenger car markets particularly, the broad mass of consumers will only switch to zero- emission vehicles once they are sure they can recharge or refuel their vehicles anywhere in the EU and as easily as is currently the case for conventionally fuelled vehicles. It is important that no EU region or territory is left behind and that regional disparities in the deployment of the infrastructure for alternative fuels are well-addressed in the formulation and implementation of national policy frameworks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="BodyText">
     <span>
      Directive 2014/94/EU on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure (‘the Directive’)
     </span>
     <span>
      sets out a framework of common measures for the deployment of such infrastructure in the EU. It requires Member States to set up national policy frameworks to establish markets for alternative fuels and ensure that an appropriate number of publicly accessible recharging and  refuelling points is put in place, particularly also to enable free cross-border circulation of such vehicles and vessels on the TEN-T network. In its recent report on the application of Directive 2014/94/EU on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure, the Commission noted some progress in the Directive’s implementation

      .
     </span>
     <span>
     </span>
     <span>
      However, the shortcomings of the current policy framework are also clearly visible: as there is no detailed and binding methodology for Member States to calculate targets and adopt measures, their level of ambition in target setting and supporting policies in place varies greatly. A comprehensive and complete network of alternative fuels infrastructure does not exist across the EU, the report concludes. Likewise, the European Court of Auditors noted in its special report on recharging infrastructure that obstacles to travelling across the EU in electric vehicles remain and that the deployment of recharging infrastructure in the Union needs to accelerate

     </span>
     <span>
      The evaluation found that the Directive is not well-adapted to the purpose of serving the increased climate ambition for 2030. The main problems include that Member States’ infrastructure planning on average lacks the level of ambition, consistency and coherence needed, leading to insufficient, unevenly distributed infrastructure. Further interoperability issues with physical connections persist, while new issues have emerged over communication standards, including data exchange among the different actors in the electro-mobility ecosystem. Finally, there is a lack of transparent consumer information and common payment systems, which limits user acceptance. Without further EU action, this lack of interoperable, easy-to use recharging and refuelling infrastructure is likely to become a barrier to the needed market growth of low- and zero-emission vehicles, vessels and – in the future – aircraft.

      This proposal is part of the overall set of interlinked policy initiatives under the ‘Fit for 55’ package.

      This initiative seeks to ensure the availability and usability of a dense, widespread network of alternative fuels infrastructure throughout the EU. All users of alternative fuel vehicles (including vessels and aircraft) need to be able to move through the EU at ease, enabled by key infrastructure such as motorways, ports and airports. The specific objectives are: (i) ensuring minimum infrastructure to support the required uptake of alternative fuel vehicles across all transport modes and in all Member States to meet the EU’s climate objectives; (ii) ensuring the infrastructure’s full interoperability; and (iii) ensuring full user information and adequate payment options.

     <span>
      Meeting the European Green Deal goal on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from transport and developing a common EU transport market require full connectivity and a seamless user experience along the European transport network for low- and zero-emission vehicles, vessels and aircraft. This in turn requires sufficient quantity and full interoperability of infrastructure across borders. Only a common European legislative framework can reach these objectives. This initiative will contribute to coherent and consistent development and rollout of vehicle fleets, recharging and refuelling infrastructure and user information and services.

      For waterborne transport, this initiative delivers on the clear requirement of the European Green Deal to oblige docked ships to use shore-side electricity. It is fully complementary to Fuel EU maritime initiative by ensuring that sufficient shore-side electricity supply is installed in ports to provide electricity while passenger ships (including ro-ro passenger ships, high speed passenger craft and cruise ships) and container vessels are at berth and accommodating the demand for decarbonised gases (i.e. bio-LNG and synthetic gaseous fuels (e-gas). For the case of passenger ships, the different ship categories vary in their power demand characteristics while at berth, which leads to different investment needs at port. This needs to be combined with the different operational characteristics of ports, including layouts and terminals. For this reason a further distinction is made on passenger ships compared to the FuelEU maritime initiative in identifying two categories, that of ro-ro passenger ships and high speed passenger vessels, and that of other passenger ships, notably cruise ships. Together with the FuelEU maritime initiative it therefore contributes to overcoming the current “chicken-and-egg” issue, which has meant that the very low demand for ship operators to connect to the electric grid while at berth has made it less attractive for ports to invest in short-side electricity. Limited introduction of On-shore power supply OPS in ports risks disturbing the level playing between ports, in particular for early investors, as not OPS equipped vessels could shift their traffic. It is therefore important that minimum requirements be set for maritime ports across the whole TEN-T network.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      The initiative is also complementary to the ReFuelEU aviation initiative. It supplements that initiative’s push for sustainable aviation fuels that largely do not require a distinct refuelling infrastructure with provisions for electricity supply for all stationary aircraft and thus supporting the decarbonisation of the aviation sector.

      Next to the legislative proposal, the Commission will address the need for additional research and innovation (R&amp;I) activities, in particular through the co-programmed Zero Emissions Waterborne Transport partnership proposed by the Waterborne Technology Platform under Horizon Europe, the Clan Sky 2 Joint Undertaking and the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking which works in synergy with these two transport partnerships.

      This initiative is also consistent with the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive. It seeks to ensure that lack of recharging and refuelling infrastructure does not hamper the overall ramp-up of renewable and low-carbon fuels in the transport sector, where they require distinct infrastructure. At Union level, there is no policy instrument equivalent to the Directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure able to ensure deployment of publicly accessible recharging and refuelling infrastructure across all modes of transport in a similar manner. This initiative is also closely linked to the upcoming proposal to revise the Regulation on the Guidelines for the Trans-European Transport Network

      . The planned revision of that Regulation will build upon and complement the alternative fuels infrastructure already deployed through individual projects on the TEN-T network corridors. By consistently cross-referencing the provisions of this initiative, the revision of the Regulation will ensure sufficient coverage on the TEN-T core and comprehensive network.

      To ensure the correct functioning of the internal market, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) establishes the Union’s prerogative to lay down provisions for the common transport policy, Title VI (Articles 90-91), and for the trans-European networks, Title XVI (Articles 170-171). With this legal framework in mind, Union action enables better coordination for the even and widespread deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure, instead of relying on Member States only. This facilitates travel across the Union in alternative fuel vehicles for both personal users and businesses. It also helps prevent a lack of, or patchy deployment of, alternative fuels infrastructure from becoming a potential barrier to the completion of the internal market and from discouraging the automotive industry’s production of zero- and low-emission vehicles.

      Meeting the European Green Deal’s transport emission reduction objectives (as corroborated by the sustainable and smart mobility strategy) requires a substantial increase in zero- and low-emission vehicles and vessels. This will not take place without the deployment of a coherent and complete network of fully interoperable alternative fuels infrastructure making it possible to travel across the Union in an alternative fuel vehicle. As noted when the current Directive was adopted, such a network cannot be adequately developed by Member States individually; instead, Union intervention is required.

      The Union added value of this intervention in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and synergies is underlined in the evaluation of the current Directive, in conjunction with the assessment of national implementation reports submitted by Member States. The evaluation showed that developing a common EU framework has to some extent helped avoid fragmentation. Such a framework has supported the development of national policies to develop alternative fuels infrastructure in all Member States and has supported the creation of a more level playing field within the industry. By encouraging interoperability, relevant technical standards and setting of targets on similar timescales, Union-level action has provided some cost savings and better value for money by facilitating economies of scale, avoiding duplication of effort and resources, and providing funding investments for infrastructure. The Directive’s implementation (and its supporting activities) have facilitated cooperation and information exchange on alternative fuels between the relevant industry and public actors. Without the Directive, such cooperation would likely not exist.

      Without Union intervention, it would be very unlikely that a coherent and complete network of fully interoperable alternative fuels infrastructure would develop across all Member States, thus ensuring that it is possible to travel across the Union in an alternative fuel vehicle. This in turn is a prerequisite for the uptake of such vehicles across the Union, which is vitally important for the EU to meet its 2030 increased climate ambition.

      . The proposed intervention sets more binding requirements on Member States to ensure the uptake of sufficient publicly accessible infrastructure for recharging and refuelling of alternative fuels vehicles in the Union. This is necessary for the EU to deliver on the increased climate and energy ambition for 2030 and meet the overall objective of reaching climate neutrality by 2050, an objective reflected in, among others,

      The experience of implementing the current Directive shows the need for this revised intervention.

      This initiative creates a stable and transparent policy framework to help create open and competitive markets, thus stimulating investment in recharging and refuelling infrastructure in all modes of transport.

      While the Impact Assessment resulted in a Directive as the preferred policy option, the Commission made the choice to propose a Regulation. The choice of a Regulation ensures a rapid and coherent development towards a dense, widely-spread network of fully interoperable recharging infrastructure in all Member States. The decision is particularly justified in view of the needed swift and coherent implementation of the national fleet-based minimum deployment targets set at Member State level and the mandatory distance-based targets along the TEN-T network, as the first proposed targets would have to be reached by 2025 already. With this timescale, building up a sufficiently dense, wide-spread network of recharging and refuelling infrastructure for zero- and low-emission vehicles throughout the Union at the same pace and under the same conditions is now of strong relevance to support the highly necessary accelerated market uptake of zero- and low-emission vehicles. This requires already in the years before 2025, the design and development of Member State plans and measures to deliver on the targets. A new Regulation establishes clearly binding and directly applicable obligations for Member States at national level,
     </span>
     <span>
      and
     </span>
     <span>
      ensuring their EU-wide coherent and timely application and implementation at the same time. It avoids the risk of delays and inconsistencies in national transposition processes, thus also creating a clear level-playing field for markets, which will help the Union-wide roll-out of recharging and refuelling infrastructure. The Regulation will establish a more robust governance mechanism that tracks Member State progress in achieving the targets and that enables Member States to set the right incentives so that competitive recharging markets can develop. Clear timelines for the design and development of Member States’ national policy frameworks to achieve the targets, robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms, as well as provisions for corrective measures by Member States can enable efficient overall monitoring and steering of efforts in Member States to achieve the targets. This initiative guarantees such an approach.

      However, shortcomings in the current policy framework have also been pointed out in the evaluation. Moreover, the Directive’s key objective, namely to ensure coherent market development in the EU, has not been met. Shortcomings arise in particular in the following three areas: (i) the lack of a complete network of infrastructure allowing seamless travel across the EU; (ii) the need for further common technical specifications to ensure interoperability in light of emerging technologies; and (iii) the lack of full user information, uniform and easy-to-use payment methods and full price transparency across the Union.

      The evaluation concluded that 6 years after the Directive’s adoption, the overall European market for alternative fuels infrastructure is still in a rather early development phase, though markets are maturing in some parts of the EU. Given the overall relevance of ensuring sufficient infrastructure to support the needed uptake of vehicles and vessels in light of the increased climate ambition for 2030, the evaluation of the Directive recommended retaining the legislation but revising it.

The Board considered that the report could be further improved by: (a) better describing the difference between the options and how they link to the identified problems; and (b) nuancing the report to clarify whether the expected impacts stem from this specific initiative or from other policies, or from a combination of the two’.

      The final impact assessment report includes a comprehensive description and assessment of the initiative’s value added and its links with other policy initiatives. These can be found in Sections 1.3, 3.3 and 8.1 of the assessment report. A detailed description of the policy options is included in Section 5, while a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of all options is presented in Section 6. The analysed policy options can be summarised as follows:

      substantive changes to the Directive
     </span>
     <span>
      . The national target setting and reporting under the national policy framework would remain an important pillar, strengthened by mandatory fleet-based targets for electric recharging points for light-duty vehicles (LDVs). For heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs), mandatory distance-based targets would be introduced along the TEN-T network for electric recharging points and hydrogen refuelling points, including limited provisions for hydrogen refuelling in urban nodes. Mandatory targets would also be introduced for stationary aircraft and shore-side electricity supply in maritime and inland waterway ports. In addition, some quality aspects of the infrastructure would be addressed to improve interoperability and user

      Policy option 2:
     </span>
     <span>
      more substantive changes to the Directive than in option 1
     </span>
     <span>
      . In addition to the mandatory fleet-based targets for electric recharging points for LDVs, distance-based targets would be set for all road vehicles infrastructure for the TEN-T network, including for urban nodes for heavy-duty vehicle infrastructure.
     </span>
     <span>
      This option would also
     </span>
     <span>
      include more detailed provisions for ports and airports on the TEN-T network and greater harmonisation on payment options, physical and communication standards and consumers’ rights while charging.
     </span>
     <span>
      It would strengthen
     </span>
     <span>

      Policy option 3:
     </span>
     <span>
      changing the Directive to a Regulation
     </span>
     <span>
      (thus going furthest in terms of binding legal instruments).

     <span>
      In

     </span>

     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="BodyText">
     <span>
      Because it strikes the best balance between the achieved objectives and the implementation cost, option 2 was identified as the best policy option. However, policy option 2 lends itself as well to a Regulation, with an accelerated impact on the implementation of provisions in this case. The impact assessment includes a detailed description of the regulatory measures included under the different policy options.

      Much greater policy ambition for the supply of sufficient and fully interoperable recharging and refuelling infrastructure is necessary to support the needed market take-up of zero- and low-emission vehicles, in line with the overall policy ambition of the ‘Fit for 55’ package and its related policy initiatives. Regulatory fitness is achieved by setting out necessary minimum requirements for public authorities and market actors. The related higher cost to public authorities for supporting infrastructure rollout, particularly in parts of the transport network where demand is low, have to be seen against the backdrop of significantly increased user demand and large-scale opportunities for market growth. The review of policies under the ‘Fit for 55’ policy package will enable the market take-up of zero-emission vehicles and the servicing of vessels equipped with shore-side electricity supply. The impact assessment provides a detailed analysis of costs and benefits, including a summary in Annex 3.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="BodyText">
     <span>
      While the review increases the overall policy ambition, it does also include some important simplification aspects. This simplification primarily affects charge point operators and mobility service providers. Setting clear and common minimum requirements will simplify their business operations, as they will face similar minimum requirements in all Member States. Such requirements will simplify the use of the infrastructure by private and corporate consumers (who currently face a plethora of use approaches) and enable better business service innovation. Consumer trust in the robustness of a Pan-EU network of recharging and refuelling infrastructure will increase, which will support the overall profitability of recharging and refuelling points and support a stable business case. All market actors and user groups will benefit from lower information costs and, in the case of market actors, lower legal compliance costs in the medium term, as the requirements for infrastructure provisioning under the Regulation will be better harmonised. Public authorities can also benefit from a coherent EU-wide framework that will simplify coordination with public and private market actors.

      The impact assessment did not identify any area where this initiative’s planned provisions would create a significant and disproportionate cost for SMEs, in comparison to all enterprises. This initiative creates long-term market certainty for investment in recharging and refuelling infrastructure and lays down the foundation for the development of an open data ecosystem that enterprises can use to develop new market services, which will benefit innovative SMEs. The initiative has an overall positive impact on the competitiveness of enterprises that install and operate recharging and refuelling infrastructure, as well as on the competitiveness of the automotive sector itself. This is because the provision of sufficient infrastructure has an impact on the market uptake of zero-emission

      should boost the production and uptake of sustainable alternative fuels in aviation and maritime transport. While the fuel use requirements for the sustainable aviation fuels can largely rely on the existing refuelling infrastructure, investments are needed for the electricity supply of stationary aircraft. The FuelEU maritime initiative sets requirements in particular for the use of on shore power that can only be fulfilled if an adequate level of on shore power supply is deployed in TEN-T ports. However those initiatives do not contain any provisions on the required fuel infrastructure which are a prerequisite that the targets can be met.

      Therefore all modes of transport should be addressed in one instrument which should take into account a variety of alternative fuels. The use of zero-emission powertrain technologies is at different stages of maturity in the different modes of transport. In particular, in the road sector, a rapid uptake of battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles is taking place. Hydrogen fuel-cell road vehicles are available to markets, as well. In addition, smaller hydrogen and battery electric vessels and hydrogen fuel-cell trains are currently being deployed in different projects and in first commercial operations, with full commercial roll out expected in the next years. In contrast, the aviation and waterborne sectors continue to be dependent on liquid and gaseous fuels, as zero- and low-emission powertrain solutions are expected to enter the market only around 2030 and in particular for the aviation sector even later, with full commercialisation taking its time. The use of fossil gaseous or liquid fuels is only possible if it is clearly embedded into a clear decarbonisation pathway that is in line with the long-term objective of climate neutrality in the Union, requiring increasing blending with or replacement by renewable fuels such as bio-methane, advanced biofuels or renewable and low-carbon synthetic gaseous and liquid fuels.

      Such biofuels and synthetic fuels, substituting diesel, petrol and jet fuel, can be produced from different feedstock and can be blended into fossil fuels at very high blending ratios. They can be technically used with the current vehicle technology with minor adaptations. Renewable methanol can also be used for inland navigation and short-sea shipping. Synthetic and paraffinic fuels have a potential to reduce the use of fossil fuel sources in the energy supply to transport. All of these fuels can be distributed, stored and used with the existing infrastructure or where necessary with infrastructure of the same kind.

      LNG is likely to play a continued role in maritime transport, where there is currently no economically viable zero-emission powertrain technology available. The Communication on the Smart and Sustainable Mobility Strategy points to zero-emission seagoing ships becoming market ready by 2030. Fleet conversion should take place gradually due to the long lifetime of the ships. Contrary to maritime transport, for inland waterways, with normally smaller vessels and shorter distances, zero-emission powertrain technologies, such as hydrogen and electricity, should  enter the markets more quickly. LNG is expected to no longer play a significant role in that sector. Transport fuels such as LNG need increasingly to be decarbonised by blending/substituting with liquefied biomethane (bio-LNG) or renewable and low-carbon synthetic gaseous e-fuels (e-gas) for instance. Those decarbonised fuels can be used in the same infrastructure as gaseous fossil fuels thereby allowing for a gradual shift towards decarbonised fuels.

      In the heavy-duty road transport sector, LNG trucks are fully mature. On the one hand, the common scenarios underpinning the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy and the Climate Target Plan as well as the revised “Fit for 55” modelling scenarios suggest some limited role of gaseous fuels that will increasingly be decarbonised in heavy-duty road transport especially in the long haul segment. Furthermore, LPG and CNG vehicles for which already a sufficient infrastructure network exists across the Union are expected to gradually be replaced by zero emission drivetrains and therefore only a limited targeted policy for LNG infrastructure deployment that can equally supply decarbonised fuels is considered necessary to close remaining gaps in the main networks.

      The deployment of publicly accessible recharging infrastructure for light-duty electric vehicles has been uneven across the Union. Continued uneven distribution would jeopardize the uptake of such vehicles, limiting connectivity across the Union. Continuing divergence in policy ambitions and approaches at national level will not create the long-term certainty needed for substantive market investment. Mandatory minimum targets for Member States at national level should therefore provide policy orientations and complement National Policy Frameworks. That approach should combine national fleet based targets with distance-based targets for the trans-European network for transport (TEN-T). National fleet based targets should ensure that vehicle uptake in each Member State is matched with the deployment of sufficient publicly accessible recharging infrastructure. Distance-based targets for the TEN-T network should ensure full coverage of electric recharging points along the Union’s main road networks and thereby ensure easy and seamless travel throughout the Union.

      National fleet based targets should be established on the basis of the total number of registered electric vehicles in that Member State following a common methodology that accounts for technological developments such as the increased driving range of electric vehicles or the increasing market penetration of fast-charging points which can recharge a greater number of vehicles per recharging point than at a normal recharging point. The methodology also has to take into account the different recharging patterns of battery electric and plug

      Implementation in Member States should ensure that a sufficient number of publicly accessible recharging points is installed, in particular at public transport stations, such as port passenger terminals, airports or railway stations. A sufficient number of publicly accessible fast recharging points dedicated to light-duty vehicles should also be deployed to increase consumer convenience in particular across the TEN-T network to ensure full cross-border connectivity and allow electric vehicles to circulate throughout the Union.

      Electric heavy-duty vehicles need a distinctively different recharging infrastructure than light-duty vehicles. Public accessible infrastructure for electric heavy-duty vehicles is however currently almost nowhere available in the Union. A combined approach of distance-based targets along the TEN-T network, targets for overnight recharging infrastructure and targets at urban nodes should ensure that a sufficient publicly accessible infrastructure coverage for electric heavy-duty vehicles is established throughout the  Union to support the expected market uptake of battery electric heavy-duty vehicles.

      A sufficient number of publicly accessible fast recharging points dedicated to heavy-duty vehicles should also be deployed along the TEN-T network to ensure full connectivity throughout the Union. That infrastructure should have sufficient power output to allow the recharge of the vehicle within the driver’s legal break time. In addition to fast recharging points along the network, heavy-duty vehicles should also be able to use publicly accessible recharging infrastructure for overnight recharging along the main transport network to specifically support the electrification of the long haul sector.

      Recharging infrastructure along the TEN-T network should be complemented with fast publicly accessible recharging infrastructure in urban nodes.

      Publicly accessible recharging or refuelling points include, for example, privately owned recharging or refuelling points accessible to the public that are located on public or private properties, such as public parkings or parkings of supermarkets. A recharging or refuelling point located on a private property that is accessible to the general public should be considered as publicly accessible also in cases where access is restricted to a certain general group of users, for example to clients. Recharging or refuelling points for car-sharing schemes should only be considered accessible to the public if they explicitly allow access for third party users. Recharging or refuelling points located on private properties, access to which is restricted to a limited, determinate circle of persons, such as parking lots in office buildings to which only employees or authorised persons have access, should not be considered as publicly accessible recharging or refuelling points.

      A recharging station is the single physical installation for the recharging of electric vehicles. Every station has a theoretical maximum power output, expressed in kW. Every station has at least one recharging point that can serve only one vehicle at a time. The number of recharging points at a recharging station determine the number of vehicles that can be recharged at that station at any given time. Where more than one vehicle recharges at that recharging station at a given time, the maximum power output is distributed to the different recharging points, such that the power provided at each individual recharging point is lower than the power output of that station. A recharging pool consists of one or more recharging stations at a specific location, including, as the case may be, the dedicated parking lots adjacent to them. For the targets set in this Regulation for recharging pools, the minimum power output required for those recharging pools could be provided by one or more recharging stations.

      enable real-time data to be produced, which is needed to ensure the stability of the grid and to encourage rational use of recharging services. By providing energy metering in real time and accurate and transparent information on the cost, they encourage, in combination with smart recharging points, recharging at times of low general electricity demand and low energy prices. The use of smart metering systems in combination with smart recharging points can optimise recharging, with benefits for the electricity system and for the end user. Member States should encourage the use of smart metering system for the recharging of electric vehicles at publicly accessible recharging stations, where technically feasible and economically reasonable, and ensure that these systems comply with the requirements laid down in Article 20 of Directive (EU) 2019/444.

      The increasing number of electric vehicles in road, rail, maritime and other transport modes will require that recharging operations are optimised and managed in a way that does not cause congestion and takes full advantage of the availability of renewable electricity and low electricity prices in the system. Smart recharging in particular can facilitate the integration of electric vehicles into the electricity system further as it enables demand response through aggregation and through price based demand response. System integration can further be facilitated through bi-directional recharging (vehicle-to-grid). All normal recharging points at which vehicles are typically parked for a longer period should therefore support smart recharging.

      The development of infrastructure for electric vehicles, the interaction of that infrastructure with the electricity system, and the rights and responsibilities assigned to the different actors in the electric mobility market, have to be consistent with the principles established under Directive (EU) 2019/944. In that sense, distribution system operators should cooperate on a non-discriminatory basis with any person establishing or operating publicly accessible recharging points and Member States should ensure that the electricity supply for a recharging point can be the subject of a contract with a supplier other than the entity supplying electricity to the household or premises where this recharging point is located. The access of Union electricity suppliers to recharging points should be without prejudice to the derogations under Article 66 of Directive (EU) 2019/944.

      The establishment and operation of recharging points for electric vehicles should be developed as a competitive market with open access to all parties interested in rolling-out or operating recharging infrastructures. In view of the limited alternative locations on highways, existing highway concessions such as for conventional refuelling stations or rest areas are a particular cause for concern, since they can run over very long periods and sometimes even lack a specified end date altogether. Member States should seek, to the extent possible and in compliance with Directive (EU) 2014/23 of the European Parliament and of the Council

      Price transparency is crucial to ensure seamless and easy recharging and refuelling. Users of alternative fuel vehicles should  be given accurate price information before the start of the recharging or refuelling service. The price should be communicated in a clearly structured manner to allow end users to identify the different cost components.

      New services emerge, particularly in support of the use of electric vehicles. Entities offering those services, such as mobility service providers, should be able to operate under fair market conditions. In particular, operators of recharging points should not give unduly preferential treatment to any of those service providers, for instance through unjustified price differentiation that may impede competition and ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers.

      The Commission should monitor the development of the recharging market. When reviewing the Regulation, the Commission will take actions where required by market developments such as limitations of services for end users or business practices that may limit competition.

      Hydrogen-powered motor vehicles have at present very low market penetration rates. However, a build-up of sufficient hydrogen refuelling infrastructure is essential in order to make large-scale hydrogen-powered motor vehicle deployment possible as envisaged in the Commission’s hydrogen strategy for a climate-neutral Europe

      . Currently, hydrogen refuelling points are only deployed in a few Member States and are largely not suitable for heavy-duty vehicles, not allowing for a circulation of hydrogen vehicles across the Union. Mandatory deployment targets for publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling points should ensure that a sufficiently dense network of hydrogen refuelling points is deployed across the TEN-T core network to allow for the seamless travel of hydrogen fuelled light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles throughout the Union.

      the heavy-duty segment was identified as the most likely segment for the early mass deployment of hydrogen vehicles. Therefore, hydrogen refuelling infrastructure should preliminarily focus on that segment while also allowing light-duty vehicles to fuel at publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling stations. To ensure interoperability, all publicly accessible hydrogen stations should at least serve gaseous hydrogen at 700 bar. The infrastructure roll out should also take into account the emergence of new technologies, such as liquid hydrogen, that allow a larger range for heavy-duty vehicles and are the preferred technology choice of some vehicle manufacturers. To that end, a minimum number of hydrogen refuelling stations should serve also liquid hydrogen in addition to gaseous hydrogen at 700 bar.

      A number of LNG refuelling points are established in the Union, already providing a backbone for the circulation of LNG driven heavy-duty vehicles. The TEN-T core network should remain the basis for the deployment of LNG infrastructure, and progressively for bio-LNG, as it covers the main traffic flows and allows cross border connectivity throughout the Union. It had been recommended in Directive 2014/94/EU that such refuelling points be installed every 400 km on the TEN-T core network, but certain limited gaps in the network remain to reach that objective. Member States should by 2025 reach that objective and fill the remaining gaps, after which the target should cease to apply.

      Users of alternative fuel vehicles should be able to pay easily and conveniently at all publicly accessible recharging and refuelling points, without the need to enter into a contract with the operator of the recharging or refuelling point or a mobility service provider. Therefore, for recharging or refuelling on an ad hoc basis, all publicly accessible recharging and refuelling points should accept payment instruments that are widely used in the Union, and in particular electronic payments through terminals and devices used for payment services. That ad hoc payment method should always be available to consumers, even when contract-based payments are offered at the recharging or refuelling point.

      Transport infrastructure should allow seamless mobility and accessibility for all users, including persons with disabilities and older persons. In principle, the location of all recharging and refuelling stations as well as the recharging and refuelling stations themselves should be designed in such a way that they can be used by as much of the public as possible, in particular by older persons, persons with reduced mobility and persons with disabilities. This should include for example providing sufficient space around the parking lot, ensuring that the recharging station is not installed on a kerbed surface, ensuring that the buttons or screen of the recharging station are at an appropriate height and the weight of the recharging and refuelling cables is such that persons with limited strength can handle them with ease.

      Under the FuelEU maritime initiative, ship operators of container and passenger ships need to comply with provisions to reduce emissions at berth. Mandatory deployment targets should ensure that the sector finds sufficient shore-side electricity supply in TEN-T core and comprehensive maritime ports to comply with those requirements. The application of these targets to all TEN-T maritime ports should ensure the level playing field between ports.

      Container ships and passenger ships, being the ship categories which are producing the highest amount of emissions per ship at berth, should as a priority be provided with shore-side electricity supply. In order to take into account power demand characteristics while at berth of different passenger ships, as well as port operational characteristics, it is necessary to distinguish between the passenger ship requirements for ro-ro passenger ships and high speed passenger vessels, and those for other passenger ships.

      These targets should take into account the types of vessels served and their respective traffic volumes. Maritime ports with low traffic volumes of certain ship categories, should be exempted from the mandatory requirements for the corresponding ship categories based on a minimum level of traffic volume, so as to avoid underused capacity being installed. Similarly, the mandatory targets should not aim to target maximum demand, but a sufficiently high volume, in order to avoid underused capacity and to take account of port operational characteristics. Maritime transport is an important link for the cohesion and economic development of islands in the Union. Energy production capacity in these islands may not always be sufficient to account for the power demand required to support the provision of shore-side electricity supply. In such a case islands should be exempted from this requirement unless and until such an electrical connection with the mainland has been completed or there is a sufficient locally generated capacity from clean energy sources.

Both the assessment of the national policy framework and the evaluation of Directive 2014/94/EU have highlighted the need for higher ambition and a better coordinated approach across Member States in view of the expected acceleration in the uptake of alternative fuel vehicles, in particular of electric vehicles. Furthermore, alternatives to fossil fuel will be needed in all transport modes to meet the ambitions of the European Green Deal. The existing National Policy Frameworks should be revised to clearly describe how the much greater need for publicly accessible recharging and refuelling infrastructure as expressed in the mandatory targets is going to be met by the Member States. The revised frameworks should equally address all transport modes including those for which no mandatory deployment targets exists.

      In order to promote alternative fuels and develop the relevant infrastructure, the national policy frameworks should consist of detailed strategies to promote alternative fuels in sectors that are difficult to decarbonise such as aviation, maritime transport, inland waterway transport as well as rail transport on network segments that cannot be electrified. In particular, Member States should develop clear strategies for the decarbonisation of inland waterway transport along the TEN-T network in close cooperation with those Member States concerned. Long term decarbonisation strategies should also be developed for TEN-T ports and TEN-T airports, in particular with a focus on the deployment of infrastructure for low and zero emission vessels and aircraft as well as for railway lines that are not going to be electrified. On the basis of those strategies the Commission should review this Regulation with a view to setting more mandatory targets for those sectors.

      It is crucial that all actors in the electric mobility ecosystem can interact easily through digital means to provide the best service quality to the end user. This requires unique identifiers of relevant actors in the value chain. To that end, Member States should appoint an Identification Registration Organisation (‘IDRO’) for issuing and managing unique identification (‘ID’) codes to identify, at least, operators of recharging points and mobility service providers. The IDRO should collect information on e-mobility ID codes that are already in use in the respective Member State; issue new e-mobility codes, where needed, to recharging point operators and mobility service providers under an Union-wide common agreed logic in which electro-mobility ID codes are formatted; allow to exchange and verify the uniqueness of these e-mobility codes via a possible future common Identification Registration Repository (‘IDRR’). The Commission should issue technical guidance on the set up of such organisation, drawing on the Programme Support Action on “Data collection related to recharging/refuelling points for alternative fuels and the unique identification codes related to e-mobility actors” (‘IDACS’).

      Alternative fuels infrastructure is a fast developing area. The lack of common technical specification constitutes a barrier for the creation of a single market of alternative fuels infrastructure. Therefore, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to norm technical specifications for areas where common technical specifications are outstanding but necessary. In particular, this should include the communication between the electric vehicle and the recharging point, the communication between the recharging point and the recharging software management system (back-end); the communication related to the electric vehicle roaming service and the communication with the electricity grid. It is also necessary to define the suitable governance framework and roles of the different actors involved in the vehicle-to-grid communication ecosystem. Moreover, emerging technological developments, such as electric road systems (‘ERS’) have to be accounted for. As concerns data provision, it is necessary to provide for additional data types and technical specifications related to the format, the frequency and the quality in which these data should be made available and accessible.
