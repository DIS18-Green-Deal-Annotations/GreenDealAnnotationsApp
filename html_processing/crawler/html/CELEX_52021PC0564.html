      The world is facing a profound climate crisis and the challenges of climate change require a global response. Strong international cooperation will strengthen the joint climate action needed by all the Parties of the Paris Agreement to meet the goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels

      To deliver on these GHG emissions reductions in line with the European Climate Law, the Commission proposes to revise where necessary all relevant policy instruments by July 2021 in a ‘Fit for 55 Package’, which covers in particular the review of sectoral legislation in the fields of climate, energy, transport, and taxation

A carbon border adjustment mechanism (‘CBAM’), announced in the European Green Deal, is part of that package and will serve as an essential element of the EU toolbox to meet the objective of a climate-neutral EU by 2050 in line with the Paris Agreement by addressing risks of carbon leakage as a result of the increased Union climate ambition.

      The Commission announced its intention to propose a CBAM in the European Green Deal. As indicated in the Communication ‘Should differences in levels of ambition worldwide persist, as the EU increases its climate ambition, the Commission will propose a carbon border adjustment mechanism, for selected sectors, to reduce the risk of carbon leakage. This would ensure that the price of imports reflect more accurately their carbon content.

      (‘EU ETS’) and is meant to avoid that the emissions reduction efforts of the Union are offset by increasing emissions outside the Union through relocation of production or increased imports of less carbon-intensive products.

      The Paris Agreement commits the international community to a continuous increase in the ambition of climate action to limit global average temperature rise in order to significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. Each Party must prepare its own nationally determined contribution (‘NDC’) towards this global goal, reflecting its ‘highest possible ambition’ as well as its ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances

     <span>
      As long as significant numbers of the EU’s international partners have policy approaches that do not result in the same level of climate ambition as the Union, and differences in the price applied to GHG emissions remain, there is a risk of carbon leakage. Carbon leakage occurs if, for reasons of differing ambitions related to climate policies, businesses in certain industry sectors or subsectors were to transfer production to other countries with less stringent emission constraints or imports from these countries would replace equivalent but less GHG emissions intensive products due to the difference in climate policy. That would risk undermining the effectiveness of the EU’s emission mitigation policies, and could also lead to an increase in their total emissions globally, thus jeopardising the reduction of GHG emissions that is urgently needed if the world is to keep the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Currently, the risk of carbon leakage is being addressed in the Union under the EU ETS. This is the world's first international GHG emissions trading system and has been in place since 2005. For the sectors covered by this system and most at risk of carbon leakage, this risk is currently managed through the granting of free allowances and compensations for the increase in electricity costs under state aid rules. However, free allocation under the EU ETS weakens the price signal that the system provides for the installations receiving it compared to full auctioning. It thus affects the incentives for investment into further abatement of GHG emissions.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      At the same time, as the Union increases its climate ambitions, the divergence with third countries’ level of climate action is expected to widen, with an increased risk of carbon leakage for the EU. This would stem from the EU’s increasingly ambitious GHG emissions reduction targets that should reduce the overall number of ETS allowances. As a consequence, the carbon price signal from the EU ETS is strengthened, incentivising Union producers to reduce their emissions, but widening the difference with countries without carbon pricing mechanisms. Moreover, overall free allocation will also decline over time, in line with the reduction of the emission cap.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal">
     <span>
      Considering the problems described above, this proposal addresses the problem of reducing GHG emissions in the Union, while at the same avoiding that these emissions reduction efforts are offset globally by emissions increase outside the Union. In this context, a CBAM is proposed with the overarching objective of addressing the risk of carbon leakage in order to fight climate change by reducing GHG emissions in the Union and globally.

      In the context of the ‘Fit for 55 Package’ the CBAM is not a self-standing measure. It is a climate policy measure aiming at preserving the integrity of the EU’s climate ambition towards the ultimate goal of climate neutrality. The role of the CBAM is to address the risk of carbon leakage and reinforce the EU ETS. There is thus a strong relation between the EU ETS and the CBAM.

      the extension of the EU ETS to maritime transport, as well as the introduction of emissions trading to the buildings and road transport sectors. Most notably, the
     </span>
     <span>
      higher climate ambition of the proposed amendments of the EU ETS appears in a more stringent cap on emissions, meaning that the overall number of allowances available will decline. A more stringent cap implies a stronger carbon price signal. The EU objective of climate neutrality and the decision to raise the climate ambition for 2030 also lead to a broader reconsideration of existing measures against the risk of carbon leakage. In particular, while free allocation of allowances effectively prevents carbon leakage risks, it weakens the carbon price signal for the Union industry compared to full auctioning.

      As indicated by the European Green Deal, the CBAM would ensure that the price of imports reflects more accurately their carbon content. This measure has been designed to comply with World Trade Organization (‘WTO’) rules and other international obligations of the Union. Furthermore, President von der Leyen has underlined that ‘carbon must have its price – because nature cannot pay the price anymore. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism should also motivate foreign producers and EU importers to reduce their carbon emissions

      To this end active outreach to third countries would be important with regard to the understanding of and compliance with CBAM requirements. Moreover, the EU will engage with third countries whose trade to the EU is affected by this Regulation to explore possibilities for dialogue and cooperation with regard to the implementation of specific elements of the Mechanism. It should also explore possibilities for concluding agreements to take into account their carbon pricing mechanism.

      The existing mechanisms to address the risk of carbon leakage are free allocation of EU ETS allowances and in some cases financial measures to compensate for indirect emission costs from increases in electricity prices due to the EU ETS (indirect emission costs). A CBAM is an alternative to those measures and would therefore have to replace them over time. However, to allow producers, importers and traders to adjust to the new regime, the reduction of free allocation should be implemented gradually while the CBAM is phased-in, in order to ensure that they are not cumulative.

      The proposal seeks to address the challenge of reducing GHG emissions in the Union while at the same time avoiding that these emissions reduction efforts are offset by emissions increase outside the Union. The policy choices therefore are clearly dictated by the aim to achieve the objectives of the CBAM, namely to address the risk of carbon leakage in order to fight climate change by reducing GHG emissions in the Union and globally.

      The proposed product coverage of the CBAM is framed by the sectors and emissions covered by the EU ETS, the sector coverage of which is in turn based on various quantitative and qualitative criteria linked to the environmental objectives of the EU ETS, and the CBAM scope should be laid down by a reference to certain goods by way of their classification in the Combined nomenclature

      . This serves the motivation for the measure, namely to ensure that risks of carbon leakage for certain energy intensive sectors are mitigated. The CBAM, builds on the climate logic of the EU ETS starting with sectors where emissions are the highest in absolute numbers and therefore where it would matter most.

As installations covered by the EU ETS are subject to a carbon price assessed on their actual emissions, imported products in the scope of the CBAM should also be assessed based on their actual GHG emissions. However, in order to allow businesses to adjust to such an approach it is proposed to start with a transitional period without financial adjustment.

In total 219 responses were submitted during this consultation period broken down into approximately 150 responses by trade federations, business associations and individual businesses, 20 NGOs, 20 citizens and the remaining from think tanks, academic/research institutions, trade unions and public authorities. The majority of responses came from the EU, with 24 from third countries.

       Overall, the majority of replies expressed support for the CBAM, with the remaining being roughly divided equally between limited and no support. The vast majority of responses expressed cautiousness in the design of the measure requesting to consider all options possible. Among others, key areas emphasized were the impact on value chains and reliance on imports of raw materials, avoidance of excessive effects on final consumers, links to EU ETS and free allowances, distributional impact in affected sectors and across countries, especially developing economies and interaction with existing trade defence measures on raw materials.

The consultation aimed to gather opinions from citizens and organisations on the justifications, objectives, potential design and scope as well as impacts of the initiative. Respondents were also allowed to upload position papers. A total of 615 respondents participated in the public consultation. Of these, 6 responses were duplicates, leading to 609 valid contributions.

       With respect to the problem of carbon leakage, most respondents state that carbon leakage is a real issue and that the CBAM can address carbon leakage, foster consumption of low-carbon products in the EU, and stimulate the deployment of low-carbon technologies and ambitious climate policies in third countries. On the effectiveness of current measures in the context of the EU ETS and state aid rules to limit carbon leakage, and on the ability of other regulatory measures to reduce GHG emissions companies, business associations and public authorities have a positive belief whereas citizens and other stakeholders are more critical. Respondents suggest that the CBAM should focus on products from activities already included in the EU ETS (especially those with the highest risk of carbon leakage) and account for entire value chains.

     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       In addition to the above, the Commission services engaged in extensive bilateral consultations with public authorities within the EU and third countries, business associations, individual companies and NGOs. At the same time targeted consultations were undertaken by an external contractor who conducted a total of 25 in-depth interviews with senior managers and associations from the basic materials sectors, manufacturers, NGOs and policymakers. There were two rounds of interviews. First, 17 informal interviews were conducted at an early stage and served to identify relevant points of concern and open questions for further research. In a second step, eight additional interviews were conducted in order to test whether the judgements and concerns from the informal interviews were shared among a wider group of stakeholders. 17 stakeholders came from industry, 5 from NGOs and 3 from Member State institutions.

      The results of the public and targeted consultations allowed the Commission to collect a significant number of views and opinions on the initiative. Both public and targeted consultations showed agreement on the necessity of a CBAM to address the risk of carbon leakage and help the Union to achieve its increased climate ambitions. The feedback received throughout these consultations has been used to inform the choice of the design elements and the preferred policy options. Result of the stakeholder consultation is summarised in the relevant annex to the impact assessment.

The Impact Assessment report was further revised along these lines, in particular, an effort was made to ensure that it is self-standing with regards to the problem of carbon leakage, while strengthening its coherence with the proposal for the revision of the EU ETS, as well as providing better clarity on the key impacts and institutional choices and presenting in greater detail the views of different stakeholder groups.

       The problem addressed by the CBAM is how to reduce GHG emissions in the EU, while at the same time avoiding that these emissions reduction efforts are offset by emissions increasing outside the Union (carbon leakage). To reflect this dynamic framework, the basis against which the impact assessment was built reflected the fact that the CBAM is put forward against the new agreed EU target of reducing net GHG emissions by at least 55 per cent (relative to 1990).

       Six different options were assessed against this dynamic framework, all of which were designed to take account of WTO requirements and of the EU’s international commitments such as free trade agreements concluded by the EU or the Energy Community Treaty.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       The first option for a CBAM is an import carbon tax, paid by the importer when products enter the EU. The tax would be collected by customs at the border based on a tax reflecting the price of carbon in the Union combined with a default carbon intensity of the products. Importers would have the opportunity to claim a reduction of the CBAM based on their individual carbon footprint and any carbon price paid in the country of production.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       The second option involves the application on imports of a system that replicates the EU ETS regime applicable to domestic production. This option entails – similar to the system of allowances under the EU ETS – the surrendering of certificates (‘CBAM certificates’) by importers based on embedded emission intensity of the products they import into the Union, and purchased at a price corresponding to that of the EU ETS allowances at any given point in time. These certificates will not be linked to the EU ETS system of allowances but will mirror the price of these allowances to ensure a coherent approach to the pricing under the EU ETS. National climate authorities will administer the sale of the CBAM certificates and importers will submit declarations of verified embedded emissions in the imported products to these authorities tasked with managing the CBAM and surrender a number of CBAM certificates corresponding to the declared emissions. Such declaration and surrendering will occur – similar to that under the EU ETS – at a yearly reconciliation exercise taking place in the year following the year of importation and based on yearly trade import volumes. The carbon emission intensity of products would be based on default values; however, importers would be given the opportunity, at the moment of the yearly reconciliation exercise, to claim a reduction of the CBAM on the basis of their individual emission performance. They would also be entitled to claim a reduction of the CBAM for any carbon price paid in the country of production (which is not rebated or in other way compensated upon export).
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       Option 3 operates in the same way as option 2, however the carbon price of imports is based on actual emissions from third country producers rather than on a default value based on EU producers’ averages. Under this option, the importer will have to report the actual emissions embedded in the product and surrender a corresponding number of CBAM certificates.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       Option 4 would apply in the same way as option 3. It consists of surrendering CBAM certificates on imported products. However, this option considers also a 10 years phasing in period starting in 2026 during which the free allocations of allowances under the EU ETS would be gradually phased out by 10 percentage points each year and the CBAM would be phased in. During this phasing in period, the CBAM would be reduced proportionally to the amount of free allowances distributed in a given sector.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       Option 5 is a variant of Option 3 with a scope extended further down in the value chain. Carbon-intensive materials that are part of semi-finished and finished products would be covered along the value chain. For imports, the CBAM would again be based on the actual emissions from third country producers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       Option 6 consists of an excise duty on carbon-intensive materials covering consumption in the Union of both domestic and imported products, besides the continuation of the EU ETS including the free allocation of allowances covering production in the EU.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       With respect to the effectiveness of the CBAM against its overarching objective of addressing the risk of carbon leakage in order to fight climate change by reducing GHG emissions in the Union and globally, the impact assessment showed that all the policy options achieve positive impact. In that respect, all CBAM options were found to achieve a stronger reduction of emissions in the CBAM sectors in the Union, relative to the case of higher ambition and free allocation. With regards to incentivising third country producers to move towards cleaner production processes, all policy options bring about positive results. On that criteria, the options allowing for the possibility to demonstrate actual emissions are particularly effective, with options 3, 4 and 5 also showing strong positive results. All options were found to be coherent with the EU ETS.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       On providing protection against carbon leakage, option 4 followed by 3 and 5 bring about a stronger positive impact, while options 1, 2 and 6 would be less effective. All policy options are designed in a way that respects the EU’s international commitments.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       The CBAM will apply on imports of goods at the price of carbon determined by the EU ETS system through the system of auctions. Importers would either be charged on the basis of a default value or based on the actual emissions embedded in the imports. The possibility to demonstrate that the carbon efficiency of their product is better than the default value, would increase the complexity of the system, but this also provides emission reduction incentives for the share of materials that is exported to the EU.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       Overall the impact of the CBAM on employment is limited. Changes in employment are largely driven by the presence (or not) of free allocation. Retaining free allocation results in a slight increase in employment in the CBAM sectors. The complete removal of free allocation in the absence of a CBAM leads to the highest employment losses. The application of the CBAM on material industrial products is likely to have limited impact on consumer prices because the measure is targeted at products upstream in the value chain and affects goods for final consumption only indirectly.

     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       Compliance costs are assumed to arise for importers located in the Union that would be subject to the CBAM obligations. This could be done either based on a default value or by providing verified information about actual emissions. While the monitoring of these actual emissions would take place outside the Union, the responsibility – and thus costs – of providing the verification
      </span>
      <span class="CommentReference">
       r
      </span>
      <span>
       egarding this monitoring to authorities lies with the importers. For options 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, when emissions are declared at default value, monitoring of the emissions from the production process is not necessary and therefore also limited costs are incurred. However, if importers decide to claim to use the actual emissions from the production process, the monitoring creates additional costs for the business. Under option 6, default values have to be determined both for materials and manufactured goods. Administrative effort is relatively low for producers of materials in the EU, which means producers do not have to demonstrate the carbon intensity of their production.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       Electricity generation is addressed separately to material products. Applying a CBAM to the electricity sector requires taking into account its uniqueness that distinguishes it from basic materials, including the methods for its transportation, through constrained, monopoly networks, and the broad set of technologies employed for its production.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       In line with approaches applied to the material products, a reference value for emissions embedded in imported electricity needs to be established in the context of determining the corresponding CBAM obligation. Two alternative options are employed to determine the reference value for embedded emissions for electricity namely (a) average GHG emission intensity of the EU electricity mix and (b) average GHG emission factor of the EU electricity mix. As with other options, however, importers would still have the possibility to prove that their installation level emissions are lower than the above reference values.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       On the basis of the above, the impact assessment concluded that option 4 provides clear benefits relative to all other options considered. It is therefore suggested to introduce a CBAM on selected products in the form of CBAM certificates based on actual emissions. It is also suggested to introduce CBAM progressively against a correspondent reduction of allowances allocated for free in the corresponding EU ETS installations. This policy option ensures a high level of effectiveness for the CBAM.

      <span>
       A system based on actual emissions on imported goods ensures a fair and equal treatment of all imports and a close correlation to the EU ETS. The CBAM system will, however, need to be complemented by a possibility to base calculations on a set of default values to be used in situations when sufficient emission data will not be available. Moreover, during an initial transitional phase, where importers may not be able to produce yet the data required by system on actual emissions, a default value could also apply. This option will need to be designed to fully respect the EU’s international commitments, in particular WTO rules, and therefore it will be necessary to ensure that if a default value applies, importers are in all cases given the opportunity to demonstrate that they perform better than such value based on their actual emissions. Moreover, with regard to the phase in of the CBAM and the corresponding phase out of the free allowances, it will need to be ensured that at no point in time over this period, imports are afforded less favourable treatment than domestic EU production.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       Further, the introduction of CBAM certificates based on actual emissions would protect against the risk of carbon leakage while incentivising third country producers to move towards cleaner production processes, with the support of Official Development Assistance when applicable.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       As regards electricity the preferred option is to apply the CBAM based on the carbon emission factor including the possibility for importers to demonstrate lower emissions. Both options contribute to mitigating the risks of carbon leakage by discouraging in the mid-term the build-up of carbon-intensive power generation sources in the vicinity of EU borders which might replace EU-based generators exposed to increasing carbon costs. However, the option based on the carbon emission factor displays superior effectiveness in preventing carbon leakage while keeping administrative costs low.

      The choice of policy option 4 for material products and the carbon emission factor for electricity would introduce a proportionate mechanism to address climate change by reducing GHG emissions in the Union and avoiding that these emissions are replaced by emissions outside the Union. In addition, the gradual phase out of free allocation under the EU ETS in the sectors concerned, combined with the gradual phase in of CBAM, would ensure a prudent and predictable transition for businesses and authorities.

       Within the framework of the overall package of environmental measures adopted and applied by the EU, which illustrate the EU's continued pursuit of a higher level of environmental ambition than many of our trading partners, it is considered appropriate to begin moving from a system in which carbon leakage is addressed by free allowances to a system in which carbon leakage with respect to imports is addressed by a carbon border adjustment mechanism as soon as this is reasonably possible, taking into account the technical and economic feasibility, including administrative constraints and the legitimate expectations of all economic operators, in an even-handed manner.

     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       Concurrently balancing these multiple objectives pleads in favour of the gradual introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism, as soon as is reasonably possible, so that during an initial and relatively short pilot phase without any financial adjustment, operators can adjust themselves to the new system, including its additional administrative requirements, and the authorities can obtain experience with respect to the operation of the new system.

     </p>
     <p class="Normal">
      <span>
       Once that pilot phase is complete, the process of transitioning from free allowances to a carbon border adjustment mechanism will accelerate in earnest and in a manner that ensures no discrimination between domestic and imported goods, or between imported goods from different countries, in full compliance with the EU's international obligations and rights.

       The Commission will ensure that arrangements are in place to monitor and evaluate the functioning of the CBAM, including its enforcement against fraudulent practices, and evaluate it against the main policy objectives. Given that the CBAM is one of the policy proposals under the ‘Fit for 55 Package’, monitoring and evaluation could be carried out in alignment with the other policies of the package.

For that, it is necessary to firstly monitor the effect of the CBAM.

More specifically, it contains provisions on the conditions to apply for an authorisation to import CBAM goods (Articles 4 and 5), the obligation of an authorised declarant to submit an annual CBAM declaration by 31 May of each year and the content of that declaration (Article 6), the principles for the calculation of the emissions embedded in goods imported to the EU during the previous calendar year (Article 7, as further outlined in Annex III) and the process of verifying these emissions by accredited verifiers (Article 8, complemented by reporting requirements and verification principles in Annexes IV and V). It also sets out the principles for taking into account a carbon price paid in third countries (Article 9). Last, under Article 10, an operator of an installation in a third country has the possibility to request to the Commission to be included in a central database. Once registered, the operator may opt to disclose information about the embedded emissions verified to an authorised declarant. The authorised declarant can use that disclosed information to fulfil the obligation to declare verified information on embedded emissions when importing the goods produced in the installation registered in the central database to the Union.

Article 20 concerns in detail the sale of certificates by the competent authorities. Article 21 is about the calculation of the price of the certificates, done by the Commission, on a weekly basis. Article 22 lays down the procedures to ensure that each authorised declarant fulfils its obligation to surrender certificates in the national registry. Article 23 establishes the right of an authorised declarant to ask the competent authority to re-purchase a limited number of CBAM certificates remaining on its account after surrender.

      As long as a significant number of the Union’s international partners have policy approaches that do not result in the same level of climate ambition, there is a risk of carbon leakage. Carbon leakage occurs if, for reasons of costs related to climate policies, businesses in certain industry sectors or subsectors were to transfer production to other countries or imports from those countries would replace equivalent but less GHG emissions intensive products. That could lead to an increase in their total emissions globally, thus jeopardising the reduction of GHG emissions that is urgently needed if the world is to keep the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels.

      The initiative for a carbon border adjustment mechanism (‘CBAM’) is a part of the ‘Fit for 55 Package’. That mechanism is to serve as an essential element of the EU toolbox to meet the objective of a climate-neutral Union by 2050 in line with the Paris Agreement by addressing risks of carbon leakage resulting from the increased Union climate ambition.

      Existing mechanisms to address the risk of carbon leakage in sectors or sub-sectors at risk of carbon leakage are the transitional free allocation of EU ETS allowances and financial measures to compensate for indirect emission costs incurred from GHG emission costs passed on in electricity prices respectively laid down in Articles 10a(6) and 10b of Directive 2003/87/EC. However, free allocation under the EU ETS weakens the price signal that the system provides for the installations receiving it compared to full auctioning and thus affects the incentives for investment into further abatement of emissions.

      The CBAM seeks to replace these existing mechanisms by addressing the risk of carbon leakage in a different way, namely by ensuring equivalent carbon pricing for imports and domestic products. To ensure a gradual transition from the current system of free allowances to the CBAM, the CBAM should be progressively phased in while free allowances in sectors covered by the CBAM are phased out. The combined and transitional application of EU ETS allowances allocated free of charge and of the CBAM should

      As an instrument to prevent carbon leakage and reduce GHG emissions the CBAM should ensure that imported products are subject to a regulatory system that applies carbon costs equivalent to the ones that otherwise would have been borne under the EU ETS. The CBAM is a climate measure which should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the Union’s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring WTO compatibility.

Conversely, those third countries or territories should be excluded from the list in Annex II and be subject to CBAM whereby they do not effectively charge the ETS price on goods exported to the Union.

The CBAM should initially apply to direct emissions of those GHG from the production of goods up to the time of import into the customs territory of the Union, and after the end of a transition period and upon further assessment, as well to indirect emissions, mirroring the scope of the EU ETS.

      The EU ETS and the CBAM have a common objective of pricing GHG emissions embedded in the same sectors and goods through the use of specific allowances or certificates. Both systems have a regulatory nature and are justified by the need to curb GHG emissions, in line with the environmental objective set out in Union.

      However, while the EU ETS sets an absolute cap on the GHG emissions from the activities under its scope and allows tradability of allowances (so called ‘cap and trade system’), the CBAM should not establish quantitative limits to import, so as to ensure that trade flows are not restricted. Moreover, while the EU ETS applies to installations based in the Union, the CBAM should be applied to certain goods imported into the customs territory of the Union.

      The CBAM system has some specific features compared with the EU ETS, including on the calculation of the price of CBAM certificates, on the possibilities to trade certificates and on their validity over time. These are due to the need to preserve the effectiveness of the CBAM as a measure preventing carbon leakage over time and to ensure that the management of the system is not excessively burdensome in terms of obligations imposed on the operators and of resources for the administration, while at the same time preserving an equivalent level of flexibility available to operators under the EU ETS.

      In order to preserve its effectiveness as a carbon leakage measure, the CBAM needs to reflect closely the EU ETS price. While on the EU ETS market the price of allowances is determined through auctions, the price of CBAM certificates should reasonably reflect the price of such auctions through averages calculated on a weekly basis. Such weekly average prices reflect closely the price fluctuations of the EU ETS and allow a reasonable margin for importers to take advantage of the price changes of the EU ETS while at the same ensuring that the system remains manageable for the administrative authorities.

     <span>
      Under the EU ETS, the total number of allowances issued (the ‘cap’) determines the supply of emission allowances and provides certainty about the maximum emissions of GHG. The carbon price is determined by the balance of this supply against the demand of the market. Scarcity is necessary for there to be a price incentive. As it is not possible to impose a cap on the number of CBAM certificates available to importers, if importers had the possibility to carry forward and trade CBAM certificates, this could result in situations where the price for CBAM certificates would no longer reflect the evolution of the price in the EU ETS. That would weaken the incentive for decarbonisation between domestic and imported goods, favouring carbon leakage and impairing the overarching climate objective of the CBAM. It could also result in different prices for operators of different countries. Therefore, the limits to the possibilities to trade CBAM certificates and to carry them forward is justified by the need to avoid undermining the effectiveness and climate objective of the CBAM and to ensure even handed treatment to operators from different countries. However, in order to preserve the possibility for importers to optimise their costs, this Regulation should foresee a system where authorities can re-purchase a certain amount of excess certificates from the importers. Such amount is set at a level which allows a reasonable margin for importers to leverage their costs over the period of validity of the certificates whilst preserving the overall price transmission effect, ensuring that the environmental objective of the measure is preserved.

      Given that the CBAM applies to imports of goods into the customs territory of the Union rather than to installations, certain adaptations and simplifications would also need to apply in the CBAM regime. One of those simplifications should consist in a declarative system where importers should report the total verified GHG emissions embedded in goods imported in a given calendar year. A different timing compared to the compliance cycle of the EU ETS should also be applied to avoid any potential bottleneck resulting from obligations for accredited verifiers under this Regulation and the EU ETS.

      The goods under this Regulation should be selected after a careful analysis of their relevance in terms of cumulated GHG emissions and risk of carbon leakage in the corresponding EU ETS sectors while limiting complexity and administrative burden. In particular, the actual selection should take into account basic materials and basic products covered by the EU ETS with the objective of ensuring that imports of energy intensive products into the Union are on equal footing with EU products in terms of EU ETS carbon pricing, and to mitigate risks of carbon leakage. Other relevant criteria to narrow the selection should be: firstly, relevance of sectors in terms of emissions, namely whether the sector is one of the largest aggregate emitters of GHG emissions; secondly, sector’s exposure to significant risk of carbon leakage, as defined pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC; thirdly, the need to balance broad coverage in terms of GHG emissions while limiting complexity and administrative effort.

      In particular, organic chemicals are not included in the scope of this Regulation due to technical limitations that do not allow to clearly define the embedded emissions of imported goods. For these goods the applicable benchmark under the EU ETS is a basic parameter, which does not allow for an unambiguous allocation of emissions embedded in individual imported goods. A more targeted allocation to organic chemicals will require more data and analysis.

      Similar technical constraints apply to refinery products, for which it is not possible to unambiguously assign GHG emissions to individual output products.

      However, aluminium products should be included in the CBAM as they are highly exposed to carbon leakage. Moreover, in several industrial applications they are in direct competition with steel products because of characteristics closely resembling those of steel products. Inclusion of aluminium is also relevant as the scope of the CBAM may be extended to cover also indirect emissions in the future.

      Import of electricity should be included in the scope of this Regulation, as this sector is responsible for 30 per cent of the total GHG emissions in the Union. The enhanced Union climate ambition would increase the gap in carbon costs between electricity production in the Union and abroad. That increase combined with the progress in connecting the Union electricity grid to that of its neighbours would increase the risk of carbon leakage due to increased imports of electricity, a significant part of which is produced by coal-fired power plants.

      CBAM certificates differ from EU ETS allowances for which daily auctioning is an essential feature. The need to set a clear price for CBAM certificates makes a daily publication excessively burdensome and confusing for operators, as daily prices risk becoming obsolete upon publication. Thus, the publication of CBAM prices on a weekly basis would accurately reflect the pricing trend of EU ETS allowances and pursue the same climate objective. The calculation of the price of CBAM certificates should therefore be set on the basis of a longer timeframe (on a weekly basis) than in the timeframe established by the EU ETS (on a daily basis). The Commission should be tasked to calculate and publish that average price.

      In order to give the authorised declarants flexibility in complying with their CBAM obligations and allow them to benefit from fluctuations in the price of EU ETS allowances, the CBAM certificates should be valid for a period of two years from the date of purchase.

The authorised declarant should build up during the year the amount of certificates required at the time of surrendering, with thresholds set at the end of each quarter.

      The physical characteristics of electricity as a product, in particular the impossibility to follow the actual flow of electrons, justifies a slightly different design for the CBAM. Default values should be used as a standard approach and it should be possible for authorised declarants to claim the calculation of their CBAM obligations based on actual emissions. Electricity trade is different from trade in other goods, notably because it is traded via interconnected electricity grids, using power exchanges and specific forms of trading. Market coupling is a densely regulated form of electricity trade which allows to aggregate bids and offers across the Union.

      Once third countries will be closely integrated into the Union electricity market via market coupling, technical solutions should be found to ensure the application of the CBAM to electricity exported from such countries into the customs territory of the Union. If technical solutions cannot be found, third countries that are market coupled should benefit from a time limited exemption from the CBAM until at the latest 2030 with regard solely to the export of electricity, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. However, those third countries should develop a roadmap and commit to implement a carbon pricing mechanism providing for an equivalent price as the EU ETS, and should commit to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 [as well as?] to align with Union legislation in the areas of environment, climate, competition and energy. That exemption should be withdrawn at any time if there are reasons to believe that the country in question does not fulfil its commitments or it has not adopted by 2030 an ETS equivalent to the EU ETS.

      The Commission should evaluate the application of this Regulation before the end of the transitional period and report to the European Parliament and the Council. The report of the Commission should in particular focus on possibilities to enhance climate actions towards the objective of a climate neutral Union by 2050. The Commission should, as part of that evaluation, initiate collection of information necessary to possibly extend the scope to indirect emissions, as well as to other goods and services at risk of carbon leakage, and to develop methods of calculating embedded emissions based on the environmental footprint methods

      The Commission should strive to engage in an even handed manner and in line with the international obligations of the EU, with the third countries whose trade to the EU is affected by this Regulation, to explore possibilities for dialogue and cooperation with regard to the implementation of specific elements of the Mechanism set out this Regulation and related implementing acts. It should also explore possibilities for concluding agreements to take into account their carbon pricing mechanism.

      As the CBAM aims to encourage cleaner production processes, the EU stands ready to work with low and middle-income countries towards the de-carbonisation of their manufacturing industries. Moreover, the Union should support less developed countries with the necessary technical assistance in order to facilitate their adaptation to the new obligations established by this regulation.

       The introduction of a CBAM envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions both in the EU-27 and in the rest of the world in the sectors covered by CBAM. The CBAM is also expected to reduce the risks of carbon leakage, therefore gradually replacing the free allocation of allowances under the EU ETS.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Text1">
      <span>
       As regards economic impacts, the modelling indicates that the introduction of a CBAM and other measures needed to reach the EU’s increased climate ambitions could lead to a GDP contraction for the EU 27 by 0.22 % to 0.23 % in 2030. Impact on the investment side is modest. On the consumption side CBAM appears to have a slightly stronger negative effect relative to the scenario of increased climate ambition and no CBAM.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Text1">
      <span>
       By effectively reducing carbon leakage, the introduction of a CBAM leads to a reduction in imports in the EU 27. Overall, the social impacts of CBAM are limited.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Text1">
      <span>
       Administrative impacts on national authorities and businesses are expected. Altogether, compliance costs for businesses and authorities, while significant, are expected to be proportionate, and manageable in light of the environmental benefits of the measure.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Text1">
      <span>
       While revenue generation is not an objective of CBAM is expected to generate additional revenue, which for 2030 is estimated at above EUR 2.1 billion.

       The CBAM is expected to be introduced in 2023. A simplified system of the CBAM scheme will be in place for the first years after the entry into force. Specifically, a transitional period will apply to facilitate the smooth roll out of the CBAM and allow traders and importers to adjust. Simplifications include the procedures applied at the border when goods are imported and the use of default values to determination the CBAM obligation.

       Reasons for action at European level (ex-ante)
      </span>
      <span>
       Reducing GHG emissions is fundamentally a trans-boundary issue that requires effective action at the largest possible scale. The EU as a supranational organisation is well-placed to establish effective climate policy in the EU, like it has done with the EU ETS.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Text1">
      <span>
       There exists already a harmonised carbon price at EU level. This consists of the price resulting from the EU ETS for the sectors covered by the system. These sectors are energy-intensive and subject to international competition. In order to ensure a well-functioning single market when the EU increases its climate ambition, it is essential that a level playing field is created for the relevant sectors in the internal market. The single effective way to do this is by taking action at the level of the EU. Any initiative needs to be implemented in a way that provides importers, regardless of country of origin and port of entry or destination within the EU, with uniform conditions and incentives for GHG emission reductions that are equivalent to those of domestic producers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Text1">
      <span>
       The only meaningful way to ensure equivalence between the carbon pricing policy applied in the EU’s internal market and the carbon pricing policy applied on imports is to take action at the level of the Union.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Text1">
      <span>
       Expected generated Union added value (ex-post
      </span>
      <span>
       ): In parallel to the EU ETS, reduction of GHG emissions and protection against the risk of carbon leakage in the EU single market can be established most adequately at the EU level. Additionally, the need for minimal administrative costs is best achieved by establishing consistent rules for the entire single market, further underlining the added value of an intervention at the EU level.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Text1">
      <span>
       The public consultation has confirmed the added value of taking action on the CBAM at the EU level. In particular, stakeholders agree that an EU CBAM is needed due to existing differences of ambition between the EU and the rest of the world and in order to support the global climate efforts. In addition, in view of the EU’s position in international trade, if it introduces a CBAM the environmental effect on international climate ambitions will be most effective as a potential example to follow.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="Text1">
      <span>
       Thus, the objective of reducing emissions and climate neutrality requires – without equally ambitious global policies – action by the European Union.

       The Commission will ensure that arrangements are in place to monitor and evaluate the functioning of the CBAM and evaluate it against the main policy objectives. Given that CBAM is one of the policy proposals under the ‘Fit for 55 Package’, monitoring and evaluation could be carried out in alignment with the other policies of the package.

       The administration system should be evaluated after the first year of operation to identify any issues also in terms of governance and potential improvements. In addition, when more data is available, the Commission will also review the scope of the CBAM to examine the possibility of extending it to cover emissions of additional sectors and further down the value chain. For this, it is necessary to monitor the effect of CBAM on the shortlisted sectors.
