The sustainable and smart mobility strategy therefore makes it a key priority to boost the uptake of zero- and low-emission vehicles, renewable and low-carbon fuels and related infrastructure for all modes of transport, without further delay. In this context, it is imperative that no EU region or territory is left behind and that regional disparities in the deployment of alternative fuels  infrastructure are duly addressed, in particular in less developed regions or regions with specific needs and circumstances</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Boosting the uptake of renewable and low-carbon fuels must go hand-in-hand with the creation of a comprehensive network of </span><span>recharging and refuelling infrastructure</span><span> </span><span>to fully enable the widespread uptake of low- and zero-emission vehicles in all transport modes</span><span>. The sustainable and smart mobility strategy enhances the ambition set out by </span><span>“</span><span>Recharge and refuel”</span><span> European flagship under the </span><span>Recovery and Resilience Facility</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

It also notes the ambition to support ports and airports in their transition to zero- and low-emission, multimodal transport, to support transport hubs and to encourage the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Commission’s proposal for a new Regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure is a key policy initiative to achieve the ambition set out in the sustainable and smart mobility strategy. This plan is published alongside the legislative proposal and outlines </span><span>a set of supplementary actions to support the rapid rollout of alternative fuels infrastructure</span><span>. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Rollout can really accelerate by improving better planning and permitting procedures, by providing targeted public support and by quickly resolving the remaining technical issues that cast doubt over investment. The Commission has frontloaded financial support under the EU budget to roll out such infrastructure. Progress in implementing the Recovery and Resilience Facility should greatly help market development while contributing to the recovery after the COVID crisis. Efficient planning and permitting will also be a factor at both national and local levels. This communication calls for better cooperation among national and local authorities and the multiple stakeholders to spread cases of good practice quickly throughout the EU. The Commission has already begun supporting this collaborative work: in drafting this plan, the Commission drew on expertise provided by the Sustainable Transport Forum (STF)</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">5</a>
               </span><span>, which brings together key public and private-sector market players.  </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal"/>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>2 </span><span>
                  <span class="tab">   </span>Where do we stand today? </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Commission report on the application of Directive 2014/94/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure provides a comprehensive assessment of the state of play of alternative fuels infrastructure rollout in the EU</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">6</a>
               </span><span>. It shows that market maturity varies considerably, depending on the mode of transport. Although some Member States have raised their ambition, the EU still lacks a comprehensive and complete network coverage of easy-to-use infrastructure, for all modes of transport. In its recent special report</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">7</a>
               </span><span> on infrastructure to charge electric vehicles, the European Court of Auditors has also stressed the significant differences between Member States in deploying charging infrastructure and it urged them to step up action. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In </span><span>road transport,</span><span> there is now considerable market momentum for electric vehicles. Registrations of new electric vehicles accelerated in many EU markets in 2020, driven by increasing model availability, extended purchase support and the requirement for manufacturers to meet CO</span><span>2</span><span> emission performance standards for cars and vans. By the end of 2020, there were 2.24 million battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in the Member States. Buses and trucks accounted for 0.3% and 0.03% of the total electric vehicle fleet, respectively</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">8</a>
               </span><span>. However, vehicle uptake remains highly concentrated in a few markets. At individual Member State level, the plan and target share to achieve by 2030 ranges from less than 1% to over 40% of electric cars in the total car fleet</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">9</a>
               </span><span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Similar to the uptake of electric vehicles, the deployment of publicly accessible recharging infrastructure is also highly concentrated. By the end of 2020, there were over 226 000 publicly accessible recharging points across the Member States, 89% of which were normal power recharging points (with power equal to or less than 22 kW) and 11% were high power recharging points (greater than 22 kW)</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">10</a>
               </span><span>. However, three Member States shared 70% of that infrastructure: the Netherlands, France and Germany</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">11</a>
               </span><span>. The level of ambition has increased in some Member States, but the planned rollout of infrastructure continues to vary greatly across the EU. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>For CNG (compressed natural gas) vehicles, which is a mature technology, the current fleet of 1.2 million vehicles is not expected to increase significantly over the coming years</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">12</a>
               </span><span>. The existing infrastructure, comprising some 3 642 refuelling points in 2020</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">13</a>
               </span><span>, seems largely sufficient to meet future demand. The same applies to current LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) infrastructure: Member States do not anticipate a notable increase in the current fleet by 2030</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">14</a>
               </span><span>. In 2020, there were around 332 LNG (liquefied natural gas) refuelling points in the EU that served the main TEN-T transport corridors and a fleet of up to 6 000 LNG trucks.</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">15</a>
               </span><span> Although some gaps persist, the refuelling infrastructure already provides an advanced network connectivity. The challenge remains to decarbonise natural gas</span><span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Hydrogen-powered vehicles remains a niche market because of still high vehicle and fuel costs and insufficient overall vehicle efficiency</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">16</a>
               </span><span>. Although some Member States have set a high level of ambition for rollout, many lack a rollout strategy. In 2020, 125 hydrogen stations were in operation, highly concentrated in a few Member States, and an overall fleet of ~2000 vehicles</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">17</a>
               </span><span>. Some manufacturers have announced series production of hydrogen fuel-cell trucks for the second half of this decade. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Only a few Member States have dedicated infrastructure for biofuels (e85, ED95) to be used in dual fuel vehicles. The volume of registrations of these vehicles remains stable, at a very low level.</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">18</a>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Concerning </span><span>waterborne transport</span><span>, there is limited data availability on the uptake of biofuels, alternatively sustainably fuelled vessels and onshore power supply (OPS)</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span>. The total number of commissioned LNG ships worldwide was about 300 in 2019. Only half of those ships were in operation; the other half remains on order. The number of electric vessels (including hybrids) in operation worldwide is similarly low: in 2019, 160 ships were in service and a further 104 were under construction, but market interest is growing. The deployment and use of OPS remains low. At the beginning of 2021, around 50 inland and maritime ports in the EU had at least one OPS connection point</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">21</a>
               </span><span>. The main objective of the </span><span>forthcoming </span><span>FuelEU Maritime initiative is to stimulate demand for alternative fuels in shipping </span><span>as </span><span>part of a package to bring the sector in line with the EU’s ambition of climate-neutrality by 2050. The growth trend in alternative fuel usage and zero- or low- emissions ships is therefore expected to accelerate over the coming years. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In terms of the use of alternative fuels in </span><span>rail,</span><span> around 60% of the network serving 80% of all traffic volume is electrified </span><span>and electrification of rail infrastructure is further progressing</span><span>. </span><span>Complementarily, </span><span>the first market orders of hydrogen fuel-cell trains have recently been placed in several Member States</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Concerning the use of alternative fuels in </span><span>aviation,</span><span> sustainable aviation fuels (advanced biofuels and renewable synthetic fuels) can already today be blended for up to 50% with kerosene and can use the existing refuelling infrastructure. Ongoing R&amp;I work could further raise the maximum share for blending. However, due to cost barriers production and use remains marginal, accounting for 0.05% of total jet fuel use</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">23</a>
               </span><span>. The </span><span>forthcoming </span><span>ReFuelEU Aviation initiative aims to address this challenge. The airline and airports industry in the EU is supporting and investing in increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuels and in renewable energy supply respectively. Many initiatives have been already undertaken by airports for reducing the impact of airport-level aviation (</span><span>stationary aircraft electricity supply at gates and outfield positions).</span><span> </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The aviation industry is also investing heavily in new electric, hybrid and hydrogen aircraft technologies. A first small fully electric aircraft was certified by European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in 2020</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">24</a>
               </span><span class="FootnoteReference"> </span><span>and zero CO</span><span>2</span><span> emissions aircraft for short haul commercial flights are expected over the next years. In addition to these developments, new concepts for fully autonomous aircraft (drones) are coming on stream, providing new solutions for cargo, but potentially also passenger transport</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">25</a>
               </span><span>. Rolling out these types of aircraft will require a sufficient renewable energy supply and investment in refuelling and recharging infrastructure at airports. This is particularly necessary for the production and supply of hydrogen</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               <span>For road transport, the total investment costs between 2021 and 2030 following the proposal for a new Regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure amount to approximately €1.5 billion annually. For maritime ports, total OPS infrastructure costs are estimated to range between €1.2 billion and €6.5 billion relative to the baseline cost for the period 2025-2050 while €3.4 billion should be spent on LNG bunkering in maritime transport (if ship-to-ship technology is used).

To achieve full interoperability across all parts of the electric vehicle recharging ecosystem, there is now an urgent need to further standardise communication interfaces and develop new data models to integrate electric vehicles into the grid, including building’s energy management systems, and to foster the development of EU-wide e-roaming networks.

               </span><span>, the European Agency for the Railways is leading the development of technical requirements and specifications in cooperation with operators, rolling stock manufacturers and fuel-cell manufacturers. To achieve this, it is crucial to factor in safe installation and performance testing. Considering these technical requirements, the Agency issues authorisations for putting rail vehicles into service and facilitates the commercialisation of rail vehicles and trains across Member States. Over the coming years, three specific technological barriers need to be overcome before hydrogen fuel-cell technology can be considered for trains as commercially viable. These barriers are:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="li Considrant">

            </p>
            <p class="Considrant">
               <span>These three high-priority topics will be the focus of R&amp;I work, possibly by stepping up coordination between future European Partnership for transforming Europe’s rail system and European Partnership for Clean Hydrogen. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Considrant">
               <span>Most of the remaining technological barriers concern the optimisation potential required to enable FCH technology to better compete with diesel or electric trains. Concretely, the optimisation potential depends directly on the FCH train itself, however, there is also much room for improvement and development in the corresponding hydrogen refuelling infrastructure as well as in the service and maintenance systems.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Considrant">
               <span>In addition, technological development in the rail sector faces a fragmented regulatory environment in terms of both European (technical specifications for interoperability) and national (NNTR – notified national technical rules) technical requirements. This has a high impact, especially since several types of trains are required to cover the whole European market. Pending the development of European technical requirements and specific standards, FCH powered trains could face market fragmentation leading to higher fixed costs, penalising the front runners if a new regulatory environment is designed for all types of use. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Considrant">
               <span>New ideas may render the rollout of electric vehicle recharging infrastructure and advanced rail technology synergistically. For example, in possible future open car-transportation wagons, specific converter components, adapted to the different, and somewhat variable voltage and frequencies of electric trains on the one hand, and the standardised recharging technology on the EVs’ side, are needed, as well as safe cabling solutions, in accordance with rail safety standards. </span>

               <span>For </span><span>maritime transport</span><span> and </span><span>inland navigation,</span><span> the development of standards is fundamental to move from high-level action, such as the work under the International Maritime Organisation Conventions/Codes</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

The importance of international standards in ports, in particular for the ship-shore interface in international maritime ports, is directly related to the promotion of safety and confidence in the development of sustainable alternative fuels (alcohols, ammonia, hydrogen, other) or electrification solutions (such as OPS and battery charging). It is also important in promoting local availability, which could create additional storage, distribution and therefore limited infrastructure needs of same kind (e.g. for advanced biofuels), particularly relevant when several fuel solutions will co-exist in combination with fuel-flexible engines. </span>

               <span>Particularly in electro-mobility, the availability of and accessibility to high-quality data is becoming essential for new services and product features supporting mass-market use. In a market comprising millions of vehicles and charging points, it is essential to connect users and infrastructure efficiently by providing seamless, user-centric solutions. </span>

               <span>At present, basic data regarding alternative fuels infrastructure, such as their location and availability, are often not shared or available. These data must be created, when necessary, and made available in an easy manner and at no cost, through a common data architecture. In consequence, the recharging and refuelling infrastructure must be capable of handling the necessary data requirements through an interoperable data infrastructure that endorses data sharing for the public interest. On this basis, advanced digital services can be provided to consumers, so as to allow new business opportunities to emerge and user experiences to improve hand in hand. This is evident for data on prices: users of an electric vehicle should know what they will pay at any given recharging point before they actually drive to it, so they can make an informed decision that meets their needs. Transparent sharing of </span><span>data on prices  will moreover support the development of fair prices for e-roaming across the EU. </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The creation of new services that will improve the overall quality and user-friendliness of the alternative fuels infrastructure will strongly depend on the openness of the data generated (e.g. access to in-vehicle data) in the whole ecosystem, and the potential connectivity with data from other sectors, such as e-commerce, insurance, banking or telecommunications.</span>

               <span>The Commission is ready to support</span><span> the accelerated rollout of alternative fuels recharging and refuelling infrastructure, including through investments in research and innovation. A swift agreement on the proposal for a new Regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure can be underpinned by extensive support for the market rollout of infrastructure under the many funds and financial instruments available at EU level. The Commission calls on Member States to make support for infrastructure rollout a key priority in planning measures under the Recovery and Resilience Facility. It underscores the benefits of updating related policies and regulations for planning and permitting at national and local levels. It is also working together with stakeholders to identify technological challenges, do the requisite standardisation work and set up a well-functioning governance of the ecosystem for battery-electric and fuel-cell electric vehicles.</span><span> </span><span>Altogether, this will make the EU's transport sector more competitive, ensure no consumers or regions are left behind, and it will drive forward the transition to sustainable and smart mobility.</span>
