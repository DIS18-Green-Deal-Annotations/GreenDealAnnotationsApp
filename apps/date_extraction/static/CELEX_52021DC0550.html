            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>We are at a pivotal moment in the world’s response to the climate and biodiversity emergencies and we are the last generation that can still act in time. This decade is a make-or-break moment for delivering on our commitments under the Paris Agreement, in the interest of the health, wellbeing and prosperity of all. The EU has led by example in setting ambitious targets for reducing net emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 and for being the first climate neutral continent by 2050. These goals are no longer aspirations or ambitions but obligations laid down in the first European Climate Law that create new opportunities for innovation, investment and jobs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In this spirit, the package of proposals aims to make the EU ‘fit for 55’ and deliver the </span><span>transformational change needed across our economy, society and industry</span><span>. This is a collective responsibility and opportunity that must be open to all, whether innovators and investors, companies and cities, or consumers, households and individuals. We all share in the benefits of more space for nature, cleaner air, cooler and greener towns and cities, healthier citizens, lower energy use and bills, as well as new jobs, technologies and industrial opportunities. The challenge at the heart of the EU’s green transition is how we can bring these benefits to all as quickly and as fairly as possible, while strengthening our competitiveness, creating the jobs of tomorrow and effectively addressing the costs and impacts of the transition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Acting before we reach irreversible tipping points will allow us to design that transformation rather than react and adapt to it. While the cost of non-action is clearly higher than the cost of fulfilling our climate ambitions, sterile numbers cannot capture the stark consequences of continuing business-as-usual. Non-action could also lead to new dividing lines: between </span><span>those who can afford clean, modern technologies based on renewables and those with no alternative to old-fashioned and polluting ones. </span><span>Next generations will bear the brunt of more frequent</span><span>-</span><span> and more intense </span><span>-</span><span> storms, wildfires, droughts and floods, as well as the conflicts that they could trigger around the world. Tackling these crises is therefore a matter of </span><span>intergenerational and international solidarity</span><span>. What we achieve in the next decade will determine our children’s future. This is why there is sustained and growing public support for climate ambition and action</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">1</a>
               </span><span>. Stepping up climate action is also an appeal of especially young people, including today’s teenagers, who, as agents of change, call on governments and the EU to act decisively and without delay to protect the climate and environment for next generations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Today’s proposals build on policies and legislation the European Union has already put in place. </span><span>The European Green Deal set the blueprint for this transformational change</span><span>. It put in place the building blocks for the economy of tomorrow with landmark strategies on biodiversity, circular economy, zero pollution, sustainable and smart mobility, renovation wave, sustainable food, hydrogen, batteries, offshore renewable energy and many others. Unprecedented resources have been earmarked to support the transition, whether through the EU’s recovery plan, </span><span>NextGenerationEU </span><span>contributing at least 37% to the green transition, the next long-term EU budget for 2021-2027 or the continued focus on sustainable finance and unlocking private investment. And we will continue to mobilise all EU policies to support the shift to climate neutrality, including research, skills, industrial, competition and trade policies. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The package is also based on clear evidence – both on the need to reach our 2030 target but also on how to achieve it in the best and fairest way possible. The 2030 Climate Target Plan</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">2</a>
               </span><span> assessed the opportunities and costs of the green transition, and showed that the balance is a positive one if we get our policy mix right. This builds on the knowledge that what is good for the planet is good for people and the economy, as reflected by the economy growing by over 62% since 1990 with emissions falling by 24% over the same period, thus clearly decoupling growth from CO</span><span>2</span><span> emissions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>This experience and knowledge enables this package to be the most comprehensive set of proposals the Commission has ever presented on climate and energy, setting the basis for new jobs and a resilient and sustainable European economy for the future. It lays the regulatory foundation to reach our targets in a </span><span>fair, cost-efficient and competitive</span><span> way. It puts a price on carbon in more sectors, which brings significant additional revenues to ensure a fair transition, and makes clean solutions cheaper. It supports greater renewable energy use and more energy savings. It facilitates growing sales of clean new vehicles and cleaner transport fuels. It ensures that industry can lead the transition and gives it the certainty it needs for boosting investment and innovation. It focuses on taxing energy sources in line with our climate goals and environmental objectives. The package translates the polluter pays principle into practice. It aims to reverse the declining trend in nature’s capacity to remove carbon from the atmosphere. And it helps to ensure that our climate goals are not undermined by the threat of carbon leakage, by encouraging global climate action. </span>

               <span>The Fit for 55 Package cements </span><span>the EU’s global leadership by action and by example</span><span> in the fight against climate change. However, EU action alone is not enough and cannot deliver the global emission reduction the world needs. The EU remains fully committed to the multilateral global order and calls upon partners around the world to work together. This is why the EU is working with the G7, the G20 and other international partners to show that increased climate ambition, economic prosperity and sustainable growth can go hand in hand. Ahead of the crucial 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (‘COP26’) in Glasgow in November 2021, this set of proposals aims to set an agenda to work with the rest of the world towards a green transition that addresses existential threats and creates new opportunities for all. </span>

                     <p class="NormalWeb">
                        <span>The Fit for 55 package consists of a set of </span><span>inter-connected proposals,</span><span> which all drive towards the same goal of ensuring a fair, competitive and green transition by 2030 and beyond. Where possible existing legislation is made more ambitious and where needed new proposals are put on the table. Overall, the package strengthens eight existing pieces of legislation and presents five new initiatives, across a range policy areas and economic sectors: climate, energy and fuels, transport, buildings, land use and forestry. </span>

                     <p class="NormalWeb">
                        <span>The legislative proposals are backed by impact assessment analysis, which takes into account the interconnection of the overall package. The analysis shows that an over-reliance on strengthened regulatory policies would lead to unnecessarily high economic burdens, while carbon pricing alone would not overcome persistent market failures and non-market barriers. The chosen policy mix is therefore a careful balance between </span><span>pricing, targets, standards and support measures</span><span>. </span>

               <span>2.1 A socially fair transition: tackling inequality and energy poverty through climate action </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The transition towards climate neutrality can be a unique opportunity to reduce systemic inequality. Carbon pricing instruments, for example, raise revenues that can be reinvested to address energy poverty and mobility challenges for the vulnerable, spur innovation and economic growth, and create employment. This is not just a matter of fairness and solidarity it is a wider societal necessity to tackle inequities that existed before the European Green Deal and that would worsen without resolute action against climate change and towards zero pollution. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>This is why </span><span>solidarity is a defining principle of the European Green Deal</span><span> – between generations, Member States, regions, rural and urban areas, and different parts of society – as exemplified by the Just Transition Mechanism and a number of other instruments put in place at EU level in recent years. Reaching climate neutrality will require a shared sense of purpose, collective efforts and a recognition of different starting points and challenges. Many citizens, especially younger people, are ready to change their consumption and mobility patterns when empowered by relevant information in order to limit their carbon footprint and to live in a greener, healthier environment. However, this package also addresses the concerns of those whose employment or income are affected by the transition.</span><span> </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>This approach is reflected across the Fit for 55 package, from sharing efforts to reach climate targets among Member States based on their relative wealth to taking into account their different capabilities when distributing revenues and to addressing inequalities within each Member State. This reflects the need for increased solidarity and social fairness to match our increased speed and ambition.</span>

Energy poverty alone affects up to 34 million people in the European Union today. The Fund will help mitigate the costs for those most exposed to fossil fuel price increases during the transition. The new Fund will promote fairness and solidarity between and within Member States while mitigating the risk of energy and mobility poverty.

It will enable Member States to support </span><span>vulnerable low and middle-income households</span><span>, transport users, and micro-enterprises affected by the impact of the extension of emission trading to building and transport. It will entail support to investments to increase the energy efficiency and renovations of buildings, clean heating and cooling, and integrate renewable energy in a manner that can sustainably reduce both </span><span>CO</span><span>2</span><span> emissions and energy bills for vulnerable households and micro enterprises. It will also finance access to zero- and low- emission mobility. Where needed and as long as it is required, the Fund can cover direct income support, while green investments </span><span>through</span><span> the Fund</span><span>, </span><span>and through a.o.</span><span> the Recovery and Resilience Facility and the European Regional Development Fund, are carried out and deliver their benefit</span><span>. </span>

It will be combined with national contributions of at least to 50 percent. </span><span class="normaltextrun">The Commission will shortly propose an amendment to the Own Resource Decision and the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 to accommodate this new instrument.  In addition, the Commission intends to lay down further guidance to Member States </span><span>through a proposal for Council Recommendation as to how best to address the social and labour aspects of the climate transition. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>To strengthen the social dimension further the Commission calls on Member States to use a part of revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances for the buildings and road transport sectors to mitigate the impact on those low and low-middle-income vulnerable households and transport users, in addition to the Social Climate Fund. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Member States with a higher share of fossil fuels in the energy mix, higher greenhouse gas emissions, higher energy intensity and lower GDP per capita will also benefit from an </span><span>enhanced Modernisation Fund</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Resources in this fund will depend on the carbon price, but the fund will be</span><span> </span><span>bolstered with an additional 192,5 million allowances. </span>

               <span>2.2 A competitive transition: New opportunities through industrial and sectoral change</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Achieving the 2030 target will require systemic transformation across the economy. The forthcoming revisions of National Energy and Climate Plans and Governance Regulation will ensure an integrated planning, implementation and monitoring of the green transition towards 2030. They will allow the EU and its Member States to progress in a balanced manner. The Fit for 55 proposals reflect this, with action across industry, transport, buildings and energy. Complementary and targeted policies at EU and national level will accelerate the change in behaviour, technological innovation and deployment, and development of new infrastructure. A cornerstone of the package is to build on the important achievements of the </span><span>EU Emission Trading System</span><span> by strengthening it and applying it to new sectors where so far emission reductions have been lacking. The experience of the last 16 years has shown that emissions trading</span><span> </span><span>is a highly effective mechanism to bring down emissions in a cost-effective way, while the revenues it generates can be used to support the transition to cleaner production and to stimulate innovation. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Next to a carbon price signal, clear </span><span>targets</span><span> are needed to drive change such as in the revised </span><span>Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR),</span><span> which will empower Member States to take national action to tackle emissions in the buildings, transport, agriculture, waste and small industry sectors. The proposal should deliver an EU-wide reduction of 40% in emissions from these sectors by 2030, compared to the situation in 2005. The principles for attributing the relative effort to each Member State remain the same as before. Their different capacities to take action will continue to be recognised by setting national targets based on GDP per capita, with adjustments made to take national circumstances and cost efficiency into account. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Applying emissions trading to new sectors complements the other policies of the package to drive changes in public and private investments, consumer behaviour and business practices. The Commission’s impact assessments show that a decision not to apply emissions trading to these areas would require much stronger regulatory measures in all sectors than proposed in this package, notably in fuel standards, renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as taxation.</span>

As they have been very difficult to decarbonise so far, they are also full of innovation and job creating potential. For instance, emissions trading in road transport will increase incentives to supply cleaner fuels for existing vehicles. It will lead to an evolution of the available fuels on the market for the existing fleet, pushing providers to decarbonise their fuels. The carbon price in itself, however, does not guarantee a quick transition to zero emission mobility for which complementary policies, including on charging infrastructure are needed. </span>

This will be done in a separate system focused on upstream fuel suppliers, putting the responsibility on fuel producers to comply with the system, rather than requiring individual households or road transport users to take part directly.

In order to enhance cooperation with our international partners and facilitate the global transition to a net zero economy, the full range of the EU’s external policy instruments will be harnessed to align with these higher goals. As part of its climate diplomacy in bilateral partnerships and multilateral organizations, the EU will ensure that it consults, explains, assists and where possible accommodates partners, while keeping the main objectives as laid down in the Paris Agreement in focus. This also includes support to climate finance to help vulnerable countries adapt to climate change and invest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </span><span>The EU and its Member States have consistently been the world’s largest contributor of public climate finance to low- and middle-income countries, and this will continue, with particular attention to the needs of the least developed countries. </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The European Union is built on the premise of developing common policies to achieve our common interests. It requires solidarity between its Member States and between its citizens to achieve these goals and enjoy its benefits, with everybody acting in line with their own capacities and competences, and respecting different national specificities and starting points in reaching the end goal. The Fit for 55 package is designed in this spirit: efforts are shared between Member States in the most cost effective way, acknowledging our differences, and support is given to those most in need, to ensure that the transition reaches everybody in a beneficial way.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The package of proposals has been carefully crafted to create the right balance of policy measures and revenues generated to design and drive a just and transformational change across the t EU economy. Changing the weight of each tool inevitably has knock-on effects on several others, and removing any of the proposed measures requires a tuning up of proposals in other areas. To make the European Union Fit for 55 and reduce in time our emissions by at least 55%, we need all these tools and this balance.</span>

               <span>The Fit for 55 package recognises that the EU citizens need to be offered better information, affordable options and appropriate incentives to make the individual changes that collectively help us live in balance with our environment and our planet. Citizens of all regions and ages will be closely involved in the implementation, for instance through the European Climate Pact and citizens’ panels of the Conference on the Future of Europe. It also acknowledges the effectiveness of putting a price on carbon and marshals the economic power of companies and markets to deliver structural changes to our economy that provide the cleaner, healthier products and services that we need. Finally, it enables the EU to shape long-term investments, lead markets and enforce new green standards. It is this combination that will make the EU fit for a climate neutral future.</span>

               <span>The Commission has now presented the necessary proposals for the EU to fulfil our commitments and targets, and to genuinely embrace the transformation that lies ahead. We invite the European Parliament and the Council to swiftly begin their legislative work on the proposals presented today, and to ensure that they are treated as a coherent package, respecting the multiple interconnections between them. </span>
